 structures to condense out of the smooth background of primordial gas
 were very large in size. These large masses then collapsed into thin
 sheets (pancakes) and fragmented into many smaller pieces the size of
 galaxies. A competing theory, sometimes called the hierarchical
 clustering model, proposes that the first structures to form were the
 size of galaxies. As galaxies clustered together, due to gravity,
 larger and larger structures were formed. (See Hierarchical Clustering

 <br> 
 (b) The tiny shift in a star's apparent position that occurs

 planet occasioned by its being viewed from two different
 locations - e.g., by observing it from two widely separated stations on

 planet. <a href="../glossary.html#F88" target="ads_dw">[F88]</a>
 <br> 
 (d) The difference in apparent direction of an object as seen 
 from two different locations; conversely, the angle at the object that

 (diurnal) parallax is the difference in direction between a

 observation. Heliocentric or annual parallax is the difference between
 hypothetical geocentric and heliocentric observations; it is the angle
 subtended at the observed object by the semi-major axis of the Earth's

 (d) A unit used by astronomers to describe stellar

 second of 
 arc, i.e. 3.08572 × 10<sup>16</sup> m, 3.26168 light years or
 2.062648 × 10<sup>5</sup> astronomical 
 units. Alternatively one parsec is the distance at which one
 astronomical unit 
 subtends one second of arc. The unit was approved at the first meeting
 of the 
 International Astronomical Union which took place in 1922. The name,
 derived from <i>par</i>allax <i>sec</i>ond, is said to have been
 proposed by Professor H. 
 H. Turner (1861-1930), Savilian Professor of Astronomy at Oxford. The idea
 of using star parallaxes for measuring astronomical distances was suggested

 between the study of quarks, leptons, gauge bosons, and Higgs physics, and
 the study of hadron physics, which aims to relate the properties of the
 hadrons to the theory of the color force. More broadly, the goals of
 particle 
 physics are to understand not only the description of the particles and
 their interactions but also why the laws of nature are what they are and
 how the universe arises from those laws. <a href="../glossary.html#K2000" target="ads_dw">[K2000]</a>

 corresponding to these degrees of freedom. For example, a single

 coordinates defining its position). It also has three components of
 momentum corresponding to these degrees of freedom. This means that

 <br> 
 (b) A fundamental constant; the
 ratio of the energy (<i>W</i>) carried by a photon to its frequency
 (<i>v</i>). A basic relationship in the quantum theory of radiation is
 <i>W = hv</i>. The value of <i>h</i> is 6.626 196 × 10<sup>-34</sup> J
 s. The Planck constant appears in many relationships in which some
 observable measurement is quantized (i.e. can take only specific
 separate values rather than any of a range of values).

 <br> 
 (d) A fundamental constant of nature that measures the
 magnitude of quantum mechanical effects. Visible light, for example,
 consists of discrete particles of light, or photons, each carrying an
 amount of energy equal to Planck's constant multiplied by the
 frequency of visible light. (The energy of one photon of visible light
 is approximately 10<sup>-18</sup> or a billionth of a billionth, the
 energy of a penny dropped to the floor from waist high.) By combining
 Planck's constant with two other fundamental constants of nature - Newton's
 gravitational constant and the speed of light - one obtains other
 "Planck units" that mark critical densities and times when quantum
 mechanics and gravity were both extremely important. For example, the
 Planck density, or Planck scale, is the density of matter above which
 the structure, and perhaps meaning, of space and time break down due
 to quantum mechanical effects. Numerically, the Planck density is
 about 10<sup>93</sup> grams per cubic centimeter. The infant Universe
 had this enormous density when it was about 10<sup>-43</sup> seconds
 old, which is called the Planck time, and when it had a temperature of
 about 10<sup>22</sup> Centigrade. At this temperature, the mean energy
 per particle was equivalent to the Planck mass, about 10 grams. (See
 Quantum Mechanics.) <a href="../glossary.html#LB90" target="ads_dw">[LB90]</a>
 <br>
 (e)
 Many things are quantized, such as the energy levels of atoms. Planck's
 constant, <i>h</i>, sets the scale of quantization: Energy levels are
 separated by amounts proportional to <i>h</i>, the amount of spin a
 particle can have is a multiple of <i>h</i>, etc. Planck originally
 found that the energy radiated by a 
 heated body was emitted in quanta, rather than emission of any continuous 
 amount being possible. The amount of energy was always an integer
 multiple of <i>hf</i> where <i>f</i> is the frequency or color of the
 radiation;  that is, <i>hf</i>
 of energy can be emitted, or 2<i>hf</i>, or 3<i>hf</i> and so on, but
 not amounts in between. By separately measuring the frequency, Planck
 deduced the value of <i>h</i>, which is 6.63 × 10<sup>-34</sup>

 This law was first proposed by Planck (1900). The problem of the
 energy distribution in black-body radiation had been studied for many
 years. The physical system considered is of extreme simplicity, and
 the failure of the existing statistical system of Maxwell and
 Boltzmann to solve the problem was rightly considered to be very
 significant (<i>see</i> ultraviolet catastrophe). Planck deduced his
 equation by assuming that electromagnetic radiation was not emitted
 and absorbed continuously as previously supposed but in quanta of

 Planck's formula was found to be in good agreement with experiment and
 it permitted the first reasonably accurate measurement of the
 Boltzmann constant, and hence of related quantities such as the charge
 of the electron and the masses of atoms. Little progress however was
 made with developing the ideas until Einstein (1905) argued that the
 quantum hypothesis would explain the photoelectric effect and Stokes'
 law, and later proposed other applications. This work led eventually
 to the development of quantum mechanics.

 </td><td><p align="justify">The Planck scale refers to certain values of
 length, time,  and energy or
 mass. To understand how these values originate, suppose you were trying
 to explain to an intelligent being in another galaxy how long humans
 typically lived. You couldn't use hours or years, because those units
 are defined 
 on earth (for example, by how long it happens to take our planet to go
 around its sun once), so a being in another galaxy wouldn't know what you
 meant. However, every physicist in the universe knows the values of
 Planck's constant (<i>h</i>), the speed of light in vacuum (<i>c</i>),
 and the universal
 strength of the gravitational force (G). You could use those values to form
 ratios that define a universal unit of time called the Planck time and then
 tell the being from another galaxy our typical lifetime in units of Planck
 times. Similar units for length and mass or energy can be defined. Max
 Planck realized this possibility and defined these units at the
 beginning of the twentieth century. Because the Planck scale units are
 the only universal ones, we expect the fundamental laws of nature to be
 simple in form when expressed in those units. <a href="../glossary.html#K2000" target="ads_dw">[K2000]</a>

 Light can be plane-polarized by reflection or on passing through
 certain substances (e.g. Polaroid). Light polarized in a certain plane
 by passing through one polarizer is totally absorbed by a second
 polarizer set to polarize at right angles. Electromagnetic waves such
 as light and those of shorter wavelength generally interact with
 matter by means of their electric fields (although energy is
 transferred equally by both). Thus, for example, the directions in
 which photoelectrons are ejected may depend upon the plane of
 polarization.
 <br>
 Radio waves are normally emitted plane-polarized. Thus if the electric
 vibrations are vertical a rod-shaped antenna, which responds to these
 vibrations, must be set vertically to detect them. An antenna
