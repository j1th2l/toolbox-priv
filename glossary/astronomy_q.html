 <td valign="top"><b>Quantum Mechanics</b>
 </td><td><p align="justify">(a) The theory that explains the dual wave-like and
 particle-like behavior of matter and the probabilistic character of
 nature. According to quantum mechanics, it is impossible to have
 complete and certain information about the state of a physical system,
 just as a wave cannot be localized to a single point in space but
 spreads out over many points. This uncertainty is an intrinsic aspect
 of the system or particle, not a reflection of our inaccuracy of
 measurement. Consequently, physical systems must be described in terms
 of probabilities. For example, in a large collection of uranium
 atoms, it is possible to accurately predict what fraction of the atoms
 will radioactively disintegrate over the next hour, but it is
 impossible to predict which atoms will do so. As another example, an
 electron with a well-known speed cannot be localized to a small region
 of space but behaves as if it occupied many different places at the
 same time. Any physical system, such as an atom, may be viewed as
 existing as a combination of its possible states, each of which has a
 certain probability. Quantum theory has been extremely successful at
 explaining the behavior of nature at the subatomic level, although
 many of its results violate our common-sense intuition. see

 (a) The brightest objects in the Universe, quasars
 can generate 
 over a trillion times as much light as the Sun from a region little
 larger than the Solar System. Most are extremely distant, which means
 that they existed long ago. <a href="../glossary.html#C95" target="ads_dw">[C95]</a>
 <br>
 (b) An intensely bright extragalactic object which
 superficially resembles a 
 star. Most exist at very high redshifts and are therefore thought to be
 the nuclei of active galaxies. [c97]
 <br> (c) Compact-looking objects, often radio sources, with
 emission lines in their spectrum which are displaced by very large
 amounts towards the red. These redshifts correspond to velocities which
 are a large fraction of the speed of light, and hence these objects are
 believed to lie at great distances. <a href="../glossary.html#McL97" target="ads_dw">[McL97]</a>
 <br> (d) Extremely distant and luminous astronomical
 objects that are 
 much smaller than a galaxy and much more luminous. Quasars may be the
 central regions of certain very energetic galaxies at an early stage
 of their evolution. It is believed that the power of a quasar derives
 from a massive black hole at its center. <a href="../glossary.html#LB90" target="ads_dw">[LB90]</a>
 <br><a href="Essay_quasar.html"><img src="essay1.gif" alt="Essay" border="0"></a>
 </p><p align="justify">An object with a
 dominant starlike (i.e., diameter less than 1") component, with
 an emission line spectrum showing a large redshift - up to <i>z</i> =
 3.53 (0.91c) for OQ 172. (The largest redshift known for a normal
 radio galaxy is <i>z</i> = 0.637 for 3C 123.) Many have multiple 
 absorption redshifts; a few have multiple emission redshifts.
 (Bahcall system: class I, <i>z</i><sub>abs</sub> <img src="../GIFS/approx.gif" alt="approx"> <i>z</i><sub>em</sub>;
 class II, <i>z</i><sub>abs</sub> significantly less 
 than <i>z</i><sub>em</sub>.) The light of most if not all quasars is
 variable over time intervals between a few days and several years, so their
 diameters must not be much larger than the diameter of the
 Solar System; yet they are the intrinsically brightest objects known
 (for 3C 273 (<i>z</i> = 0.158), <i>M<sub>v</sub></i> = -27.5 if its
 redshift is cosmological). The energy output of a typical quasar at
 "cosmological" distance is of the order of 10<sup>47</sup> ergs per
 second - which would require a mass of 10<sup>10</sup> <i>M</i><sub><img src="../GIFS/smsun.gif" alt="smsun"></sub> if it derives its
 energy solely from nuclear fusion. (Energy requirement under the
 "local" hypothesis is on the order of 10<sup>42</sup> ergs per
 second.) The basic problem of quasars is that they emit too much
 radiation in too short a time from too small an area. <a href="../glossary.html#H76" target="ads_dw">[H76]</a>
 <br> (e) An extreme form of active galactic nucleus in
 which the 
 luminosity of the nucleus far exceeds the luminosity of the underlying
 galaxy. As a result, these objects have a stellar appearance on
 photographic plates. The first members of this class were discovered
 through the optical identification of extragalactic radio sources and
 hence the origin of the name `quasi-stellar radio source' abbreviated
 to quasar. The quasars are the most luminous objects known in the
 Universe. <a href="../glossary.html#D89" target="ads_dw">[D89]</a>
