 <td valign="top"><a name="F18"><b>False Vacuum</b></a>
 </td><td><p align="justify">(a) A region of space that appears to be empty (a
 vacuum),
 but actually contains stored energy. When this stored energy is
 released, the false vacuum is said to decay. (see Vacuum) <a href="../glossary.html#LB90" target="ads_dw">[LB90]</a>
 <br> (b) A peculiar state of matter which has never been
 observed, but which is predicted to exist by many modern theories of
 elementary particles, including the grand unified theories; like the
 ordinary vacuum, a false vacuum has no structure, so motion through a
 false vacuum cannot be detected; unlike the ordinary vacuum, a false
 vacuum has a large (positive) energy density and a large negative
 pressure; a false vacuum is the driving force behind the rapid
 expansion in the inflationary Universe model. (see Inflationary
 Universe) <a href="../glossary.html#D89" target="ads_dw">[D89]</a>
 <br>
 (c) The false vacuum is a peculiar form of matter which is predicted
 to exist by many (probably most) current theories of elementary
 particles. Particle physicists describe the false vacuum, like all
 forms of matter, in terms of fields. Originally the phrase "false
 vacuum" was used to describe a region in which one or more fields have
 a set of values that do not minimize the energy density, but which are
 in a local valley of the energy density diagram. Classically such a
 state would be absolutely stable, since there would be no energy
 available for the fields to jump over the hills that surround the
 valley. By the rules of quantum theory, however, the fields can tunnel
 through the hill of the energy density diagram and settle eventually
 in the true vacuum, the state of lowest energy density. The false
 vacuum is nonetheless metastable, and in fact it can endure for a
 period which is long by early Universe standards. The false vacuum has
 a negative pressure which creates a repulsive gravitational field,
 capable of driving the Universe into a period of exponential expansion
 called inflation. Similar effects occur if the fields are at the top
 of a broad plateau, instead of in a valley, so in some cases the
 phrase "false vacuum" includes this case as well. <a href="../glossary.html#G97" target="ads_dw">[G97]</a>

 <td valign="top"><b>False Vacuum Bubble</b>

 (b) Quarks and leptons appear to come in three families, although only one
 family appears to be needed to explain the world we see. The other families
 differ only in that they are heavier. We do not yet understand why
 there are three families, but we can fully describe their
 behavior. This is one of the main mysteries of particle physics. <a href="../glossary.html#K2000" target="ads_dw">[K2000]</a>

 <br> (b) A particle that obeys Fermi-Dirac statistics and has
 half-integral spin.
 <br>
 Elementary fermions are conserved in number in all interactions. The
 production of a new fermion is always accompanied by the production of
 an antiparticle which is counted as <i>minus</i> the particle. The
 lepton is one type of fermion which appears most often in the charged
 form, the electron. When an electron is created in beta decay an
 antineutrino is also produced. This can be regarded as an uncharged
 antiparticle, and is counted as <i>minus one</i> lepton. The positron
 is regarded as a charged antiparticle to the electron. When
 electron-positron pairs are generated by radiation or annihilate to
 radiation the total number of leptons is conserved.
 <br>
 Similarly baryons are conserved. In a high-energy reaction a
 proton-antiproton pair may be generated. The proton counts as <i>plus
 one</i> baryon and the antibaryon as <i>minus one</i>. Thus the number
 remains constant on production of the pair, and similarly when the
 antiproton subsequently annihilates with a proton, producing pions.

 (see Antiparticle; Fermi-Dirac Statistics. <a href="../glossary.html#DC99" target="ads_dw">[DC99]</a>
 <br> (c) An elementary particle whose spin is a
 half-integral multiple

 antiparticles, and obey the Pauli exclusion principle

 Planck's constant divided by
 2<img src="../New_Gifs/pi.gif" alt="pi">. All the known elementary
 particles of 
 matter (i.e. the quarks and leptons) are fermions. Collections of
 particles in which the combined spin is half-integral (e.g. the
 Helium-3 nucleus) also behave as fermions. <a href="../glossary.html#D89" target="ads_dw">[D89]</a>
 <br> (e) A particle, or pattern of string vibration, with
 half a whole 
 odd number amount of spin; typically a matter particle. <a href="../glossary.html#G99" target="ads_dw">[G99]</a>
 <br> (f) Particles with half-integral spin. Fermions obey the
 exclusion principle, which says that no two fermions can exist in an
 atom in the same quantum state; in practice this restricts the number
 of electrons, which are fermions, permitted in each electron
 shell. <a href="../glossary.html#F88" target="ads_dw">[F88]</a>

 quantum theory are applied to the electromagnetic field, one concludes
 that the energy is concentrated into indivisible lumps, called
 photons, which behave essentially as particles. In present-day

 with three terminals that, like the junction transistor, is used in

 <i>gate</i>. An n-type FET consists of a single piece of n-type
 semiconductor, which has the source at one end and the drain at the
 other. A heavily-doped p-type region in the middle forms the gate. If
 the gate voltage is more negative than the source, electrons move from
 the n-type region to the p-type region leaving an area round the gate
 with fewer electrons to carry current. This has the effect of
 narrowing the conducting channel through which the source-drain
 current flows by an amount that depends on the source-gate voltage
 difference. In the FET, only one type of charge carrier - electrons in
 the n-type FET and holes in the p-type FET - determines the current
 and it is therefore known as a <i>unipolar</i> transistor. In the

 omega begins bigger than 1, it should get bigger and bigger as time
 goes on; if it begins smaller than 1, it should get smaller and
 smaller. For omega to be near 0.1 today, about 10 billion years after
 the big bang, it had to be extraordinarily close to 1 when the
 Universe was a second old. Some people consider such a fine balance to
 have been highly unlikely according to the standard big bang model,
 and thus are puzzled as to why the Universe today is almost flat. (see

 Fluorescence, like luminescence, can be produced in a number of
 ways. Examples are by bombardment with electrons and by absorption of
 other electromagnetic radiation. In the case of electromagnetic
 radiation the emitted radiation often has lower frequency than the
 absorbed radiation. A particular example is the absorption of
 ultraviolet radiation followed by emission of visible radiation. This
 effect is used in fluorescent paints and in 'fabric brighteners' added
 to detergents. The inside coating of fluorescent tubes is another

 <td valign="top"><b>Froude Number (Fr)</b>
 </td><td><p align="justify">A non-dimensional parameter, sometimes called a
 Froude constant, used in 
 fluid dynamics to describe the flow of a fluid in which there is a free
 surface. 
 It is defined by the relationship <i>Fr = v/(gl)</i><sup>1/2</sup>,
 where <i>Fr</i> is the Froude number, 
 <i>v</i> is the velocity of the liquid, <i>g</i> the acceleration due
 to gravity and <i>l</i> is a 
 parameter representing length. The flow of an inviscid, incompressible
 fluid 
 in two geometrically similar flow systems is dynamically similar when their
 Froude numbers are the same. The number is named after William Froude
 (1810-1879), who derived it in 1869. It is used extensively by naval
 architects. In France it is called the Reece number after F. Reece
 (1805-1884), 
 a French naval officer from Alsace. All Froude's original notebooks,
 together 
 with those of his son R. E. Froude (1846-1924), are in the Admiralty 
 Establishment in Gosport, Hampshire.
 <br>
 The number 1/<i>Fr</i><sup>2</sup>, which identifies the stability of
 flow in terms of velocity 
 gradient at a fixed surface, is sometimes called the Richardson number
 (<i>Ri</i>) 
 after Colonel A. R. Richardson of London University, who was very
 prominent in fluid mechanical research immediately before and after the
 1914-1918 war. Low values of <i>Ri</i> indicate the fluid is
 homogeneous. <a href="../glossary.html#JM92" target="ads_dw">[JM92]</a>
