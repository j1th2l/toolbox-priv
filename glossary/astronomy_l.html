A Lagrangian is an equation that contains representations o
f all of the 
fundamental particles in the world and specifies how they interact. Given 
the Lagrangian, the rules of quantum theory specify how to calculate the 
behavior of the particles, how to build up all of the composite systems they
form, and all the consequences of the basic theory.

 </td><td><p align="justify">(a) First proposed in 1760; then restricted to
 visible light, it is now used with all radiations. The law concerns
 the rate of absorption of radiation as it travels deeper into a
 medium. It states that equal thicknesses of the medium absorb equal
 proportions of the incident radiation. In other words, the intensity
 <i>I</i> of the transmitted radiation falls off exponentially with
 distance <i>d</i> in the medium:

 </p><p align="center">
 <i>I</i> = <i>I</i><sub>0</sub>
 exp -<img src="../New_Gifs/alpha.gif" alt="alpha"><i>d</i>

 Here <i>I</i><sub>0</sub> is the intensity of the initially incident
 radiation, and

 absorption coefficient</i> of the 
 medium. As well as depending on the medium,
 <img src="../New_Gifs/alpha.gif" alt="alpha"> varies with wavelength.

 (b)  In photometry, the fact that the luminous intensity of a
 diffuse surface varies with angle of view:

 </p><p align="center">
 <i>I</i><sub>0</sub> = <i>I</i><sub>0</sub> cos
 <img src="../New_Gifs/theta.gif" alt="theta">

 Here, <i>I</i><sub>0</sub> is the intensity along the normal, while
 <i>I</i> is that along a line at angle

 is often called <i>Lambert's cosine law</i>. <a href="../glossary.html#DC99" target="ads_dw">[DC99]</a>

 direction from a
