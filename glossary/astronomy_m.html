 <br> (c) The Mach Number is used frequently in
 aerodynamics. It is the ratio of the speed 
 of an object compared with the speed of sound in the same medium. The
 number owes its origin to the Austrian scientist E. Mach (1838-1916) who
 first used it in 1887. It is also employed in ballistics and in

 <td valign="top"><b>Mach's Principle</b>
 </td><td><p align="justify">(a) The precept that the inertia of objects
 results not from 
 their relationship to Newtonian absolute space, but to the rest of the
 mass and energy distributed throughout the Universe. though unproved
 and perhaps unprovable, mach's principle inspired einstein, who sought
 with partial success to incorporate it into the general theory of
 relativity. <a href="../glossary.html#F88" target="ads_dw">[F88]</a>
 <br> (b) A pre-relativity statement to the effect that the local
 inertial frame is determined by some average of the motion of
 all the matter in the Universe. in essence, mach's principle says
 that space, which is the arena in which matter interacts, is itself
 an aspect of that matter. <a href="../glossary.html#H76" target="ads_dw">[H76]</a>
 <br> (c) The hypothesis that the inertia of bodies - that is,
 their resistance to acceleration by applied forces - is determined not
 by any absolute properties of space but by the effects of distant
 matter in the Universe. equivalently, mach's principle proposes that
 the distinction between accelerated and nonaccelerated frames of
 reference is determined by the effects of distant matter. <a href="../glossary.html#LB90" target="ads_dw">[LB90]</a>

 magnitude 6 or higher cannot be detected with the naked eye. The Full
 Moon has a magnitude of -11, and the Sun one of -26.8. In order to
 standardize measurements of the brightness of more distant objects,
 the system of absolute magnitude is used. A measure of the radiation

 magnitude. <a href="../glossary.html#A84" target="ads_dw">[A84]</a>
 <br> (c) The measure of a star's brightness. apparent magnitude
 measures a star's apparent brightness - that is, how bright a star looks
 from Earth. absolute magnitude measures a star's intrinsic
 brightness - that is, how much light the star actually emits. <a href="../glossary.html#C95" target="ads_dw">[C95]</a>
 <br> (d) The brightness of a star or planet, expressed on
 a scale in 
 which lower numbers mean greater brightness. apparent magnitude
 indicates the brightness of objects as we see them from earth,
 regardless of their distance. Absolute magnitude is defined as the
 apparent magnitude a star would have if viewed from a distance of ten
 parsecs, or 32.6 light-years. each step in magnitude equals a
 difference of 2.5 times in brightness: the brightest stars in the sky

 accuracy, in the case of the second to an accuracy better than one in
 10<sup>13</sup>. An 
 outcome of the new definition is that the speed of light has become the
 second 
 physical constant to be fixed by convention, the other being the
 permeability of free space.

 The metre had its origin in August 1793 when the Republican Government
 in France decreed the unit of length would be 10<sup>-7</sup> of the
 earth's quadrant 
 passing through Paris and that the unit would be called the metre. A
 survey of 
 the arc was made from Dunkerque to Rodez by Mechain and from Rodez to
 Barcelona by Delambre and this was completed in five years whereupon three
 platinum standards and several iron copies of the metre were made. 
 Subsequent examination showed that the length of the earth's quadrant
 had been 
 wrongly surveyed but instead of altering the length of the metre to
 maintain the 10<sup>-7</sup> ratio, the metre was redefined as the distance
 between two marks on a bar.
 <br>
 In the nineteenth century scientists throughout the world gradually adopted
 the metric system for their measurements. This led to the standardization
 of the metre which was ratified at the Metric Conference in Paris in 1875.
 The present international prototype metre, which was established in 1889,
 was a direct consequence of this conference. During the century many of
 the non-metric countries passed the necessary legislation to define the
 metre in terms of their own units of length. Thus the United States 
 Congress defined the metre in terms of the US yard and in 1866 the British
 Parliament, through the Weights and Measures Act 1866, permitted the metric
 system to be used for contracts but not for trade. Scientists, however,
 were not 
 satisfied at having to use an arbitrary standard as their fundamental
 unit. As 
 early as 1828 Babinet suggested the wavelength of light as a natural unit
 of length but over 130 years had to elapse before the wavelength unit was
 adopted. In the intervening years two serious attempts were made to
 establish 
 an optical unit of length. One was by Michelson in 1895 when he suggested
 the red line of cadmium; the other took place in 1907 when spectroscopists
 defined their unit - the ångström - in terms of this line
 which made 
 the ångström equal to 1.0000002 × 10<sup>-10</sup> m,
 whereas it was meant to represent 
 a distance of 10<sup>-10</sup> m exactly. This discrepancy was overcome
 when the 
 metre was redefined in terms of the wavelength of the orange line of
 krypton 
 at the 11th CGPM (1960). In the same year a proposal was before the
 British Parliament to define the imperial standard yard in terms of the
 metre 
 so that 1 yard = 0.9144 metre exactly. Pressure of parliamentary business
 delayed the passing of the necessary act until 1963, since which time the
 metre has been the basic unit of length in both the metric and imperial
 system of units. <a href="../glossary.html#JM92" target="ads_dw">[JM92]</a>

 10<sup>-7</sup> of the wavelength. Using lasers, half-widths of the
 order 10<sup>-12</sup>
 <img src="../New_Gifs/lambda.gif" alt="lambda"> can be
 obtained. Low-quantum-energy gamma 
 rays emitted by atoms bound in crystals may have values of the order
 10<sup>-13</sup> <img src="../New_Gifs/lambda.gif" alt="lambda">.
 <br>
 Simple quantum theory leads one to expect perfectly sharp lines in a
 line spectrum - the energies of the levels concerned appear to be
 exactly defined, so that
 <img src="../New_Gifs/lambda.gif" alt="lambda"> = <i>hc</i> /
 <img src="../New_Gifs/big_delta.gif" alt="Deltaa"><i>E</i>. However,
 because of the 
 uncertainty principle, no energy level or transition can be defined
 exactly; this means that any line is naturally broadened rather than
 being sharp. A second broadening influence is the Doppler effect,
 which is relevant as the radiating particles are always in
 motion. Thirdly, collisions between emitting particles will broaden
 the emitted line.

 <td valign="top"><b>Multiples and Numbers</b>
 </td><td><p align="justify">In April 1795 the French Revolutionary Government
 introduced prefixes to 
 represent the multiples and submultiples of the basic metric
 units. Those given 
 below, with their recognized modern abbreviations, are still in use.

  <br>
 10<sup>3</sup>, kilo (k); 10<sup>2</sup>, hecto (h); 10<sup>1</sup>,
 deca (da); 10<sup>-1</sup>, deci (d); 10<sup>-2</sup>, centi (c); 
 10<sup>-3</sup>, milli (m).

 <br>
 In the past 150 years the following additional prefixes have been
 added to the list:

 <br>
 10<sup>24</sup>, yotta (Y); 10<sup>21</sup>, zetta (Z); 10<sup>18</sup>,
 exa (E); 10<sup>15</sup>, peta (P); 10<sup>12</sup>, tera (T); 
 10<sup>9</sup>, giga (G); 10<sup>6</sup>, mega (M); 10<sup>4</sup>,
 myria (my); 10<sup>-6</sup>, micro (µ); 10<sup>-9</sup>, nano 
 (n); 10<sup>-12</sup>, pico (p); 10<sup>-15</sup> femto (f);
 10<sup>-18</sup>, atto (a); 10<sup>-21</sup>, zepto (z);
 10<sup>-24</sup>, 
 yocto (y).

 <br>
 The names for the prefixes of 10<sup>±21</sup> and
 10<sup>±24</sup> were approved by the CIPM 
 in 1990. The names are derived from septo (7 × 3 = 21) and octo (8
 × 3 = 24) 
 but to avoid confusion with s, the abbreviation for second, the initial
 letter of septo was changed to z.

 <br>
 The 9th CGPM (1948) approved a nomenclature for large numbers
 based on multiples of a million in which the name (<i>N</i>)illion is
 used to indicate 
 values of 10<sup>6N</sup>. Thus, when <i>N</i> = 1, the resulting number
 10<sup>6</sup> is called a million; 
 with <i>N</i> = 2 the number 10<sup>12</sup> is a billion; with <i>N</i>
 = 3 it is 10<sup>18</sup>, a trillion; <i>N</i> = 4, 
 10<sup>24</sup>, a quadrillion. A different practice, however, is
 followed by financiers and 
 many of the public on both sides of the Atlantic in which the
 nomenclature is 
 based on 10<sup>(3Y+3)</sup>, thus when <i>Y</i> = 1, the number
 (10<sup>6</sup>) is still a million, but 
 10<sup>9</sup> is called a billion, 10<sup>12</sup> a trillion and
 10<sup>15</sup> a quadrillion. This system is not 
 recommended by IUPAP[53].

 <br>
 The prefix micro was at one time used to indicate 10<sup>-12</sup> but
 it was superseded by pico during the 1939-1945 war.

 <br>
 The 13th CGPM (1968) recommended that powers of 10 should be 
 expressed in units of 10<sup>±3n</sup> where <i>n</i> is an
 integer; thus the Planck constant 
 should be written as 662.6 × 10<sup>-36</sup> J S whereas it had
 previously been given as 6.626 × 10<sup>-34</sup> J S.

 <br>
 In the 1860s G. J. Stoney proposed a nomenclature in which powers of
 ten were indicated by an appended cardinal number when the exponent of 10
 was positive and a prefixed ordinal when the exponent was negative; thus
 10<sup>10</sup> metre would be called a metre ten and 10<sup>-10</sup>
 metre a tenth metre. 

 <br>
 During the 1970s a system somewhat similar to Stoney's began to be used
 in computer printouts. In this a number such as 47 × 10<sup>3</sup>
 would be shown as 
 47E + 3, whereas 47 × 10<sup>-9</sup> would appear as 47E - 9. The
 advantage of the 
 system is that the indices denoting the power of 10 are printed on the same
 line as the numbers to which they refer. Numbers which have neither to be
 raised nor reduced by a power of 10 are printed without the letter
 E. Thus 47 
 would be written as 47 or alternatively as 47E + 0. <a href="../glossary.html#JM92" target="ads_dw">[JM92]</a>
