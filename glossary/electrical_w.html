 <td valign="top"><b>Wave Function</b>
 </td><td><p align="justify">(a) The mathematical object in quantum theory which
 determines probabilities of different results of experiments. It is a
 complex quantity, so it has an amplitude (whose square gives the
 probability) and a phase-angle. The phase-angle has no direct physical
 interpretation, but is important in interference effects, where two
 wave-functions are added together. <a href="Glossary_index.html#D89" target="ads_dw">[D89]</a>
 <br> (b) The mathematical description of a physical system
 according to the laws of quantum mechanics. The wave function tells
 what possible states the physical system could be in and what is the
 probability of being in any particular state at any given moment. <a href="Glossary_index.html#LB90" target="ads_dw">[LB90]</a>
 <br>(c) A mathematical function that describes the
 wave-mechanical state 
 of a system (atomic or nuclear). In a one-electron atom, it yields
 the likelihood that the electron will be found

 interpretation can be generalized to more complicated systems. <a href="Glossary_index.html#H76" target="ads_dw">[H76]</a>

 Schrodinger's wave equation. Furthermore, the probability of finding
 the particle at a particular point in space is given by the absolute
 square of the wave function. <a href="Glossary_index.html#CD99" target="ads_dw">[CD99]</a>
 <br> (c) The distance between two successive peaks (often called
 crests) of the propagating disturbance of a wave. <a href="Glossary_index.html#G97" target="ads_dw">[G97]</a>
 <br> (d) In electromagnetic radiation, the distance between
 successive crests of the "waves" radiated. The number of such crests
 passing a fixed point in 1 second is known as the frequency (a crest
 per second = 1 Hertz); a short wavelength thus implies high
 frequency. Of light, the unit of wavelength is the angstrom (Å),
 measured as 10<sup>-10</sup> meters. Visible light is of between 4,000 and
 7,500 Å; different wavelengths are perceived by the eye as the
 different colors of the spectrum. Radio wavelengths, however, may
 measure from about 50 cm to about 10,000 m. <a href="Glossary_index.html#A84" target="ads_dw">[A84]</a>

 1872 to replace reciprocal
 wavelength in spectroscopy. In its original form the wavenumber represented
 the number of wavelengths per millimetre but today it is the number of

<br> (b) A small, faint, dense, dying star that has
 used up its 
 nuclear fuel and is slowly fading from view. A typical white dwarf has
 60 percent of the Sun's mass but is little larger than the
 Earth. White dwarfs are common, accounting for 10 percent of all stars
 in the Galaxy; the nearest is Sirius B, just 8.6 light-years away. But
 no white dwarf is visible to the naked eye. <a href="Glossary_index.html#C95" target="ads_dw">[C95]</a>

 matter cannot enter. The initial singularity of the standard big bang
 theory is an example of a white hole.  It can be shown that the
 creation of a new universe from a false vacuum bubble in the context
 of classical General  Relativity would  require a  white  hole
 singularity, which means essentially that it cannot be done, even in
 principle. However, a false vacuum bubble  could conceivably grow to

 <td valign="top"><b>White Light</b>
 </td><td><p align="justify">Visible radiation that gives a
 sensation of whiteness. The effect is very subjective and depends
 very much upon conditions and contrast. Light from a lamp with
 filament temperature about 2000K may be regarded as white, but in
 contrast to a filament at 3000K it appears yellow. Sunlight normally
 appears white, but a small beam of sunlight entering a room lit mainly
 by filament lamps can appear blue-green. Yet the Sun is sometimes
 classified as a yellow star, in contrast to some stars with radiating
 surfaces at higher temperature.
 <br>
In all the above cases the effect is caused by a continuum over the
 whole visible spectrum. The sensation of whiteness can also be
 produced by suitable combinations of parts of the spectrum; for
 example, two complementary colors or three primary colors. <a href="Glossary_index.html#DC99" target="ads_dw">[DC99]</a>

 </td><td><p align="justify">A term used to describe the spectral range within
 which the 
 Earth's atmosphere is transparent to radiation (see Optical Window;
 Radio Window). Earth's atmosphere is completely opaque to X-rays;
 ultraviolet radiation is absorbed by electronic transitions in the
 ozone layer, but it is possible to get above 
 some of it in balloons and rockets. Infrared radiation is absorbed by
 water vapor, so a high mountain or desert will let 
 some radiation through (the vibrations of molecules cause absorption
 in the near-infrared, and the rotation of molecules 
 causes absorption in the far-infrared and short radio). Wavelengths
 beyond the radio window are absorbed by the ionosphere. <a href="Glossary_index.html#H76" target="ads_dw">[H76]</a>
