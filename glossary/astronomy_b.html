 2-dimensional and actual space is 3-dimensional, the geometry of the
 analogy is one dimension lower than that of the actual universe.

 <br>
 (c) The unit of nuclear cross-section equal to

 of the order 10<sup>-14</sup>m, which leads to a figure of the order of
 10<sup>-28</sup>m<sup>2</sup> for the 
 cross-sectional area. The unit gives a measure of the probability of a
 particular 
 nuclear process (e.g. absorption, fission, scatter) occurring when nuclear 
 projectiles pass through matter by giving the effective target area of the 
 bombarded nucleus for that particular area. The cross-sectional areas
 vary from 
 10<sup>-4</sup> barn for certain nuclear reactions to 10<sup>-11</sup>
 barn for electron bombardment 
 experiments. The name barn was made up by H. G. Holloway and C. P. Baker
 in Chicago in 1942[9]. They used it originally as a code word to
 describe the 
 probability of certain reactions. It is possible that the authors had
 the idea the 
 barn provided a target sufficiently large so that even a temporary war-time
 rifleman could not miss it. The unit was recommended by IUPAP in 1960 but
 in July 1976, the Council of Ministers of the EEC proposed the
 abolition of the

 <td valign="top"><b>Bell's Paradox</b>
 </td><td><p align="justify">A supposed paradox arising from theoretical work
 on quantum mechanics by the Irish physicist John Bell. The work
 concerns the interpretation of quantum mechanics put forward by Niels
 Bohr, who argued that quantum mechanics depended on probabilities and
 that particles had an indeterminate existence until they were
 observed. Einstein never accepted this idea - he believed that there
 was some underlying deterministic mechanism governed by so-called
 <i>hidden variables</i>.
 <br>
 As an attack on Bohr's theories he (with others) postulated a thought
 experiment known as the <i>Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen experiment (or EPR
 experiment)</i>. One simple form of it is to think of a particle of
 zero spin decaying into two particles with spin, which fly
 apart. Because spin is conserved, the particles must have opposite
 values; if one has a spin `up' the other must have spin `down'. In the
 experiment, one waits until the particles are several meters apart and
 then measures the spin of one particle. One instantly knows the spin
 of the other (because it must be opposite). But according to Bohr, the
 spin is neither `up' nor `down' until it is measured but is in an
 indeterminate state. Einstein argued that this could not be the
 case. Otherwise, one particle would have to communicate instantly
 across space. In Einstein's interpretation, the spins would be
 determined at the time of decay of the original particle and would be
 governed by hidden variables.
 <br> In 1961 Bell proved a theorem, <i>Bell's theorem</i>, concerning
 measurements of spin in different directions for two particles. He
 showed that a certain set of inequalities (<i>Bell's inequalities</i>)
 would hold if hidden variables operated and Einstein was correct. If
 Bohr was correct, they would not hold.
 <br>
 The theorem opened the way for a real experimental test of the
 theories. In 1985 Alain Aspect did such an experiment in Paris, making
 simultaneous measurements on photons separated by 12 meters. The
 results of the <i>Aspect experiment</i> supported Bohr's
 interpretation of quantum mechanics rather than Einstein's.
 <br>
 The consequence of this is very mysterious (hence the 'paradox'). It
 seems that two particles can be a large distance apart and still be
 part of a single system with neither one state nor another but a
 superposition of both. This phenomenon is known as <i>quantum
 entanglement</i>. <a href="../glossary.html#DC99" target="ads_dw">[DC99]</a>

 hole in a matt-black,  heated hollow chamber. Since radiation entering

 radiant energy emitted  by a blackbody at  any wavelength depends only
 on  the absolute temperature of  the body, and is given mathematically

 <br>(b) A unique type of radiation whose spectrum and
 other properties are completely characterized in  terms of a single
 quantity, temperature. Blackbody radiation is produced after a group
 of particles and photons have come into thermal equilibrium with each
 other, with every reaction  between the particles balanced  by the
 reverse  reaction, so that the system  as a whole has stopped
 changing. In this situation, all parts of the system, including the
 radiation, have come  to the same temperature. Blackbody radiation
 would be produced, for example, inside an oven that is maintained at a
 constant temperature and in which the door has been left closed for a
 long time. (See photon; spectrum; thermal equilibrium.) <a href="../glossary.html#LB90" target="ads_dw">[LB90]</a>.

 <br>
 (d) If a closed box made of any material is heated to
 a  uniform    temperature, the  interior   will   become  filled  with
 electromagnetic radiation (photons)   with an intensity and   spectrum
 determined by the temperature alone, independent of the composition of
 the  box.  Radiation   with this  intensity  and  spectrum is   called
 blackbody,   or thermal  radiation.  The  intensity  and spectrum  are
 determined   by the criterion of  thermal  equilibrium; i.e., only for
 this  intensity   and spectrum will  the   absorption  and emission of
 photons  by the  walls  be  in balance  for  each wavelength,  so  the
 intensity for each wavelength can be independent of time. The universe
 today  appears  to   be  permeated with   blackbody    radiation  at a
 temperature of  2.73Â°K - the   cosmic background radiation  - which we

 events outside the hole, which can. Black holes might form, for
 example, from the gravitational collapse of a massive star. When the
 star shrinks inside an event horizon, it will collapse without known

 `hole'. Spherical black holes (without electric charge) are known as

 caused by the collapse of a small but massively dense star through the

 the gravitational force is so strong it prevents even light from
 escaping. Black holes may form the "power centers" of galaxies, thus
 explaining infrared radiation detected in several galactic
