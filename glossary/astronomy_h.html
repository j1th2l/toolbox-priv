 <br>(b) Region of ionized hydrogen in interstellar space. H II
 regions occur near stars with high luminosities and high surface
 temperatures. The kinetic temperature of H II regions is about
 10,000-20,000 K, and the density is about 10 atoms per cm<sup>3</sup>.
 Ionized hydrogen, of course, having no electron, does not produce
 spectral lines; however, occasionally a free electron will be 
 captured by a free proton and the resulting radiation can be
 studied optically (see also radio recombination lines). <a href="../glossary.html#H76" target="ads_dw">[H76]</a>

 <td valign="top"><b>Hadron</b>
 </td><td><p align="justify">(a) The generic name for any particle which
 experiences the strong nuclear force. <a href="../glossary.html#CD99" target="ads_dw">[CD99]</a>
<br> 
 (b) The word applied to an object made of quarks and/or
 antiquarks. Thus protons, neutrons, antiprotons, antineutrons and
 pions are examples of hadrons. Since quarks have `color' they
 experience the strong QCD forces and so therefore do hadrons. Examples
 of particles which are not hadrons are leptons (electrons, neutrinos,
 muons, etc.) and photons and W and Z particles. <a href="../glossary.html#D89" target="ads_dw">[D89]</a>
<br> 
 (c) Elementary particles that are influenced by the
 strong nuclear 
 force. There are two sorts of hadrons - mesons, which have zero spin,
 and baryons, which have spin 1/2 or 3/2. <a href="../glossary.html#F88" target="ads_dw">[F88]</a>
 <br>(d) Strongly interacting elementary particles. The hadrons all
 tend to have high masses. <a href="../glossary.html#P88" target="ads_dw">[P88]</a>
<br>
 (e) The properties of the color force and the rules of quantum theory
 allow 
 certain combinations of quarks (and antiquarks) and gluons to bind together
 to make a composite particle; all such particles are called hadrons. When
 mainly three quarks bind, the resulting hadron is called a baryon. When
 quark and antiquark combine, the result is called a meson, and when gluons
 combine, it is called a glueball. Hadrons have diameters of about
 10<sup>-13</sup> cm. 
 The proton and neutron are the most familiar baryons. Pions are the
 lightest mesons, so they are produced frequently in collisions. Kaons
 are the next lightest hadrons; their properties make them useful in
 many studies. <a href="../glossary.html#K2000" target="ads_dw">[K2000]</a>

 abundance. <a href="../glossary.html#A84" target="ads_dw">[A84]</a>
 <br>(b) The second lightest (atomic number two) and
 second most common 
 element in the universe. Most of it was produced by the big bang, with
 main-sequence stars making an additional contribution. It has two
 stable isotopes, helium-3 (two protons and one neutron) and helium-4
 (two protons and two neutrons). The latter isotope is by far the more
 common; it is also the most stable and tightly bound of the light
 nuclei. <a href="../glossary.html#C95" target="ads_dw">[C95]</a>

 (c) A colorless monatomic gas; the first member of the rare 
 gases (group 18 of the periodic table). Helium has the electronic
 configuration 1s<sup>2</sup> and consists of a nucleus of two protons
 and two neutrons (equivalent to an
 <img src="../New_Gifs/alpha.gif" alt="alpha">-particle) with two
 extra-nuclear 
 electrons. It has an extremely high ionization potential and is
 completely resistant to chemical attack of any sort. The gas accounts
 for only 5.2 × 10<sup>-4</sup>% of the atmosphere; up to 7% occurs in
 some natural gas deposits. Helium is the second most abundant element
 in the universe, the primary process on the Sun being nuclear fusion
 of hydrogen to give helium. Helium is recovered commercially from
 natural gas in both the USA and countries of the former USSR and it
 also forms part of ammonia plant tail gas if natural gas is used as a
 feedstock. Its applications are in fields in which inertness is
 required and where the cheaper alternatives, such as nitrogen, are too
 reactive; for example, high-temperature metallurgy, powder technology,
 and as a coolant in nuclear reactors. Helium is also used for balloons
 (it is less dense than air) and for low-temperature physics research.
 <br>
 Helium is unusual in that it is the only known substance for which
 there is no triple point (i.e., no combination of pressure and
 temperature at which all three phases can co-exist). This is because
 the interatomic forces, which normally participate in the formation of
 solids, are so weak that they are of the same order as the zero-point
 energy. At 2.2 K helium undergoes a transition from liquid helium I to
 liquid Helium II, the latter being a true liquid but exhibiting
 superconductivity and an immeasurably low viscosity
 (<i>superfluidity</i>). The low viscosity allows the liquid to spread
 in layers a few atoms thick, described by some as `flowing uphill'.
 <br>
 Helium also has an isotope. <sup>3</sup>He is formed in nuclear
 reactions and by decay of tritium. This also undergoes a phase change
 at temperatures close to absolute zero.

 for heavier nuclei to form. The theory of the Big Bang predicts the
 fraction of nuclei that are helium. That fraction has been measured,
 and the observed amount agrees very well with the predicted

 expansion), and the extreme sensitivity of the nuclear reaction
 rate to temperature causes the helium-burning process to

<br> 
 (d) Higgs fields constitute a set of
 fundamental fields, named after P.W. Higgs, which induce spontaneous
 symmetry breaking, e.g. in the Glashow-Weinberg-Salam model and in
 grand unified theories; a Higgs particle is associated with a Higgs
 field in the same way that a photon is associated with the
 electromagnetic field, The Glashow-Weinberg-Salam theory predicts a
 neutral Higgs particle with a mass-energy in the vicinity of 100 GeV
 (billion electron-volts); grand unified theories typically predict
 Higgs particles with mass energies of order 10<sup>14</sup> GeV (see
 spontaneous symmetry breaking.) <a href="../glossary.html#D89" target="ads_dw">[D89]</a>
<br>
 (e) In the Standard Model, particles (bosons and fermions) are thought
 to get 
 mass by interacting with the Higgs field. The Higgs field and the way the
 particles interact with it must have very special properties for the masses
 to be included in the theory in a consistent way. The other fields we know
 of arise from particles that carry charges, but we do not yet
 understand the origin of the Higgs field. That is why physicists are
 very nervous about the Higgs physics and do not yet agree about whether
 Higgs bosons exist, even though there is good indirect evidence for the
 Higgs bosons. Many extensions of the Standard Model imply the existence
 of a Higgs field. See also Higgs Mechanism. <a href="../glossary.html#K2000" target="ads_dw">[K2000]</a>

 temperature, even though these regions were too far apart when they
 emitted their radiation to have exchanged heat and homogenized during
 the time since the beginning of the universe. In particular, we
 detect the same intensity of cosmic radio waves (cosmic background
 radiation) from all directions of space, suggesting that the regions
 that emitted that radiation had the same temperature at the time of
 emission. However, at the time of emission, when the universe was
 about 1 million years old, those regions were separated by roughly 100
 million light years, much exceeding the distance light or heat could

 years after the big bang, and has been observed to have the same
 temperature in all directions to an accuracy of one part in
 100,000. Calculations in the traditional big bang theory show that the
 sources of the background radiation arriving today from two opposite
 directions in the sky were separated from each other, at 300,000 years
 after the big bang, by about 100 horizon distances. Since no energy or
 information can be transported further than one horizon distance, the
 observed uniformity can be reconciled only by postulating that the
 universe began in a state of near-perfect uniformity. See also

<br>
 (b) According to Hubble's law, discovered by Edwin Hubble
 in 1929, distant galaxies are receding from us, on average, with a
 speed equal to the product of the Hubble constant and the distance to
 the galaxy. Hubble's "constant" is independent of distance, but
 actually decreases slowly in time as the expansion is slowed by the
 gravitational pull of each galaxy on all the others. The present value
 is somewhere between 15 and 30 kilometers per second per million
 light-years. <a href="../glossary.html#G97" target="ads_dw">[G97]</a>
<br>
 (c) The constant of proportionality in the Hubble
 law. Its value must vary 
 with time, so it is often referred to as the Hubble parameter. The
 Hubble constant is generally used to mean the value of the Hubble
 parameter at the current epoch, and is somewhere between 50 and 100
 km/s/Mpc with possibly a value close to 75 km/s/Mpc. <a href="../glossary.html#C97" target="ads_dw">[C97]</a>

 approximately fifty kilometers of velocity per megaparsec of
 distance. <a href="../glossary.html#F88" target="ads_dw">[F88]</a>
<br> 
 (d) The rate of expansion of the universe. The Hubble
 constant actually changes in time, even though it is called a
 constant, because gravity is slowing down the rate of expansion of the
 universe. The Hubble constant is equal to the recessional speed of a
 distant galaxy, divided by its distance from us. Assuming a
 homogeneous and isotropic universe, the recessional speed of a distant
 galaxy is proportional to its distance; thus the Hubble constant as
 determined by any receding galaxy should be the same, yielding a
 universal rate of expansion of the universe. According to estimates,
 the current value of the Hubble constant is approximately 1 per 10
 billion years, meaning that the distance between any two distant
 galaxies will double in about 10 billion years at the current rate of
 expansion. Astronomers measure the Hubble constant in units of
 kilometers per second per megaparsec. For example, a Hubble constant
 of 100 kilometers per second per megaparsec - which astronomers would
 refer to simply as a Hubble constant of 100 - corresponds to 1 per 10

 may be neutral (H I regions) or ionized (H II regions). <a href="../glossary.html#A84" target="ads_dw">[A84]</a>
 <br>(b) The lightest and most common element in the universe. It has
 atomic number one and was produced by the big bang. Hydrogen-1 (one
 proton and no neutrons) is the most common isotope; hydrogen-2 (one
 proton and one neutron), or deuterium, is rarer; and hydrogen-3 (one
 proton and two neutrons), or tritium, is radioactive. <a href="../glossary.html#C95" target="ads_dw">[C95]</a>
<br> 
 (c) A colorless gaseous element; the least dense and most
 abundant element in the Universe and the ninth most abundant element
 in the Earth's crust and atmosphere (by mass). It occurs principally
 in the form of water and petroleum products; traces of molecular
 hydrogen are found in some natural gases and in the upper
 atmosphere. Hydrogen occupies a unique position among the elements as
 hydrogen atoms are the simplest of all atoms. The hydrogen atom
 consists of a proton (positive charge) with one extranuclear electron
 (1s<sup>1</sup>).
 <br>
 Atomic nuclei possess the property of `spin' and for diatomic
 molecules there exists the possibility of having the spins of adjacent
 nuclei aligned (<i>ortho</i>) or opposed (<i>para</i>). Because of the
 small mass of hydrogen, these forms are more important in hydrogen
 molecules than in other diatomic molecules. The two forms are in
 equilibrium with parahydrogen dominant at low temperatures, rising to
 75% orthohydrogen at room temperatures. Although chemically identical
 the melting point and boiling point of the para form are both about
 0.1° lower than the 3:1 equilibrium mixture.
 <br>
 Natural hydrogen in molecular or combined forms contains about one
 part in 2000 of deuterium, D, an isotope of hydrogen that contains one
 proton and one neutron in its nucleus.

 density, <i>B</i>, of a ferromagnetic substance against the
 magnetizing field strength, <i>H</i>. The substance is first brought
 to magnetic saturation from an unmagnetized state - this produces
 curve OA (see illustration). As the field strength is taken through
 one cycle of reductions, reversals, and increases, the curve follows
 the path ACDEFGA. This is known as a hysteresis loop.
 <br>
 The area of the loop equals the energy loss in taking the sample once
 through the cycle. This is known as hysteresis loss and depends on the
 substance.
 <br>
 OC (or OF) represents the <i>remanence</i>, the magnetic flux density
 remaining in the specimen when the saturating field is removed. OD (or
 OG) represents the <i>coercivity</i>, the value of the magnetizing
 field strength needed to reduce this remaining flux density to
 zero. All these details are readily explained by the domain behavior
 of ferrogmagnetics. <a href="../glossary.html#DC99" target="ads_dw">[DC99]</a>
