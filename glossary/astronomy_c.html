 <td valign="top"><b>Carbon Dating</b>
 </td><td><p align="justify">A method of dating -
 measuring the age of (usually archaeological) materials that contain
 matter of living origin. It is based on the fact that <sup>14</sup>C,
 a beta emitter of half-life approximately 5730 years, is being formed
 continuously in the atmosphere as a result of cosmic-ray
 action. (radiocarbon dating) 
 <br>
 The <sup>14</sup>C becomes incorporated into living organisms. After
 death of the organism the amount of radioactive carbon decreases
 exponentially by radioactive decay. The ratio of <sup>12</sup>C to
 <sup>14</sup>C is thus a measure of the time elapsed since the death
 of the organic material.
 <br>
 Uncertainties arise because of uncertainty as to the past rate of
 production of <sup>14</sup>C, the possibility of exchange of carbon
 with carbon of a different age during the elapsed time, the
 possibility of contamination of the sample, and the effect of burning
 of fossil fuels on the composition of atmospheric carbon.
 <br>
 The method is most valuable for specimens of up to 20 000 years old,
 though it has been modified to measure ages up to 70 000 years. For
 ages of up to about 8000 years the carbon time scale has been
 calibrated by dendrochronology; i.e. by measuring the

 Fission of <sup>235</sup>U yields a varying number of neutrons
 depending on the energy of the incident neutrons. Neutrons may escape
 from the mass of uranium or be absorbed by nonfissile nuclei and so be
 ineffective in promoting the chain reaction. If one fission produces
 neutrons which, in turn, cause more than one fission, there is a
 branching chain reaction, which may be explosive. On the other hand,
 if insufficient neutrons are captured the chain reaction will die
 out. To sustain a controlled chain reaction in natural uranium, it is
 necessary to slow down the neutrons in a moderator. Slow neutrons are
 more likely to cause fission in <sup>235</sup>U than to be captured by
 the more abundant nonfissile isotope <sup>238</sup>U. A chain reaction
 can only be sustained in uranium without using a moderator if the

 <br>(e) A universe that has a finite size. Closed universes
 expand for a finite time, reach a maximum size, and then collapse. In
 closed universes, the inward pull of gravity dominates and eventually
 reverses the outward flying apart of matter; that is, gravitational
 energy dominates the kinetic energy of expansion. The value of omega
 is greater than 1 for a Closed Universe. If a universe begins closed,
 it remains closed; if it begins open, it remains open; if it begins
 flat, it remains flat. In the Big Bang model of the Universe, the
 question of whether  the Universe is closed, open,  or flat is
 determined by the initial conditions, just as the  fate of a rocket
 launched from earth  is determined by  its initial upward velocity
 relative to the strength of earth's gravitational pull. If the initial
 rate of expansion of the Universe was lower  than a critical value,
 determined by the mass density, the Universe will expand only for a
 certain period of time and then collapse, just as a rocket launched
 with a velocity below a critical value, dependent on the strength of
 earth's gravity, will reach a maximum height and  then fall back to
 earth. This is the behavior of a Closed Universe. If the initial rate
 of expansion of the Universe was  larger than a critical value, the
 Universe is open and will keep expanding forever. If the initial rate
 of expansion was precisely the critical value, the Universe is flat
 and will expand forever, but with a rate of expansion that approaches
 zero. (see Flat Universe; Omega; Open Universe.) <a href="../glossary.html#LB90" target="ads_dw">[LB90]</a>

 do with ordinary color. Color is the source of the strong force which

 variations, called 
 colors, usually labeled as red, green, and  blue. The color of a quark

 colors. Measurable properties  of the quarks,  such as electric charge
 and mass,  depend on the  flavor but not the color,  but the  color is
 responsible for the  interactions that bind  the quarks together  (see
 Yang-Mills theories). Individual  quarks cannot  exist  independently,
 but are  forever confined within baryons  or mesons,  each of which is
 colorless.  Baryons achieve colorlessness by   being composed of three
 quarks, one  of   each color, while  mesons   achieve colorlessness by
