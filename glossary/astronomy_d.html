 </td><td><p align="justify">(a) Material astronomers cannot see but whose presence
 they believe in either because they detect its gravitational influence or
 because certain theories predict its existence. For example,
 astronomers believe that the outer part of the Galaxy harbors dark
 matter, because they notice its gravitational influence on the stars
 they can see; and inflationary cosmologists believe that the universe
 is full of dark matter, because inflation predicts that the universe
 has a large density. <a href="../glossary.html#C95" target="ads_dw">[C95]</a>
 <br> (b) Any form of matter which exists in the Universe
 in a non-luminous form. <a href="../glossary.html#C97" target="ads_dw">[C97]</a>
 <br> (c) Matter whose existence is inferred on the basis of
 dynamical studies - e.g., the orbits of stars, in galaxies - but which
 does not show up as bright objects such as stars and nebulae. Its
 composition is unknown: It might consist of subatomic particles, or of
 dim dwarf stars or black holes, or a combination of various sorts of
 objects. <a href="../glossary.html#F88" target="ads_dw">[F88]</a>
<br> (d) Matter that is invisible to us because it emits
 little or 
 no light. As much as 90%-99% of the mass of the universe may be
 dark. <a href="../glossary.html#HH98" target="ads_dw">[HH98]</a>
<br> (e) Matter that is detected only by its gravitational pull on
 visible matter. At least 90%, and possibly 99% of the matter in the
 universe is dark. The composition is unknown; it might consist of very
 low mass stars or supermassive black holes, but big-bang
 nucleosynthesis calculations limit the amount of such baryonic matter
 to a small fraction of the critical mass density. If the mass density
 is critical, as predicted by the simplest versions of inflation, then
 the bulk of the dark matter must be a gas of weakly interacting
 non-baryonic particles, sometimes called WIMPS (Weakly Interacting
 Massive Particles). Various extensions of the standard model of
 particle physics suggest specific candidates for the WIMPs. <a href="../glossary.html#G97" target="ads_dw">[G97]</a>
<br> (f) Matter in the universe that we detect by its
 gravitational 
 influences, yet do not see. Dark matter that has small random speed
 and is easily concentrated by gravity is called cold dark matter. Dark
 matter that has large random speed and is thus able to resist
 gravitational clumping is called hot dark matter. Recent models to
 explain the observed pattern of galaxy clustering can be
 characterized, in part, as to whether they invoke hot dark matter or
 cold dark matter. However, since we do not know what the dark matter
 is, we do not have any direct evidence of whether it is cold or
 hot. <a href="../glossary.html#LB90" target="ads_dw">[LB90]</a>

 dipole moments for molecules are a multiple of 10<sup>-18</sup>

 dipole moment of hydrochloric acid is 1.05 × 10<sup>-18</sup>
 e.s.u. cm; for aniline it is 
 1.5 × 10<sup>-18</sup> e.s.u. cm. The unit first received a name
 in 1934, but it is

 also been 
 defined as the product of the electronic charge and either the radius
 of the first 
 Bohr orbit of hydrogen, giving a value of 2.54 × 10<sup>-18</sup>
 CGS units, or one 
 ångström, giving a value of 4.803 × 10<sup>-18</sup> CGS

 radioactivity falls with time; the activity is proportional to the
 amount of substance present.

</p></td></tr><tr>
 <td valign="top"><b>Decay of the False Vacuum</b>
 </td><td><p align="justify">Since the universe is not inflating today,
 the inflationary theory depends on the fact that the false vacuum
 which drives inflation is metastable, so it will eventually decay. The
 theory requires that this decay happen after more than 100 doubling
 times of the exponential expansion, but it still happens when the
 universe is much less than one second old. If the inflaton fields are
 in a local valley of the energy density diagram (see Figure 10.1 on
 page 168), then the decay happens via the formation of bubbles, like
 the boiling of water, and the randomness of the bubble formation
 destroys the homogeneity of the universe and causes the theory to
 fail. This failure is called the graceful exit problem of the original
 inflationary theory. If, however, the inflaton field is at the top of
 a local plateau, see Figure 12.1 on page 209) as assumed in the new
 inflationary universe theory, then inflation continues as the fields
 roll gently towards a minimum energy value, and a single bubble
 becomes large enough to encompass the entire observed universe. <a href="../glossary.html#G97" target="ads_dw">[G97]</a>

 <td valign="top"><b>Deceleration Parameter</b>
 </td><td><p align="justify">(a) Quantity designating the rate at which the
 expansion of the universe is slowing down, owing to the braking
 effect of the galaxies' gravitational tug on one another. It is a
 function of the cosmic matter density. <a href="../glossary.html#F88" target="ads_dw">[F88]</a>
 <br> (b) A parameter that measures the rate of slowing
 down of the expansion of the universe. Gravity causes the slowing
 down. The deceleration parameter equals omega (another cosmological
 parameter) when the universe is dominated by radiation, approximately
 the first 100,000 years after the big bang, and 1/2 omega when the
 universe is dominated by matter. Since the deceleration parameter is
 equivalent to omega (assuming a cosmological constant of zero, as
 often done), it determines the ultimate fate and spatial geometry of
 the universe. The deceleration parameter is often denoted by the
 symbol <i>q</i><sub>0</sub>. (see Omega.) <a href="../glossary.html#LB90" target="ads_dw">[LB90]</a>
 <br> (c) A dimensionless quantity describing the
 rate at which the expansion of the Universe is slowing down
 because of self-gravitation: it gives a measure of the matter
 density. In Friedmann's equation (which describes many cosmological
 models) <i>q</i><sub>0</sub> = - 1 indicates a steady-state universe,
 <i>q</i><sub>0</sub> &lt; +1/2 indicates an open universe,
 <i>q</i><sub>0</sub> = +1/2 indicates a flat Euclidean universe, and
 <i>q</i><sub>0</sub> &gt; 1/2 indicates a universe that is decelerating and
 will eventually contract. Sandage and Tammann (1975) obtain
 <i>q</i><sub>0</sub> = 0.10 for <i>H</i><sub>0</sub> = 55 km
 s<sup>-1</sup> Mpc<sup>-1</sup>. <a href="../glossary.html#H76" target="ads_dw">[H76]</a>

 onto the sky of the Earth's equator. Range of declination is from from
 zero to ± 90°. <a href="../glossary.html#McL97" target="ads_dw">[McL97]</a>
 <br> (d) Angular distance on the celestial sphere north or
 south of 
 the celestial equator. It is measured along the hour circle passing
 through the celestial object. Declination is usually given in
 combination with right ascension or hour angle. <a href="../glossary.html#S92" target="ads_dw">[S92]</a>
 <br> (e) Angular distance north (+) or south (-) of the

 radiation of mixed wavelengths is deviated by refraction, the angle of
 deviation will vary with wavelength. This is called dispersion; the
 radiation is spread out. It can be used to produce the color spectrum
 of white light using a prism. It can also be a problem, causing
 chromatic aberration in lenses.
 <br> Dispersion is actually an effect in which radiations having different
 wavelengths travel at different speeds in the medium. Normally the
 refractive index increases as the wavelength decreases, but there are
 regions, where the radiation is partially absorbed, in which
 refractive index decreases with decreasing wavelength. (see

 </p><p align="justify">
 <br> (b)  An apparent change in the frequency of a
 wave motion, caused by relative motion between the source and the
 observer. It is found with sound waves: as the source and observer
 move together the apparent frequency of the sound is higher than that
 produced; as they move apart it is lower. An example is that of an
 approaching motorbike - the pitch of the engine sound appears to drop
 suddenly as it passes.

 <br> The apparent frequency (<i>f</i>') of sound as a result of relative
 motion between source and observer in a direct line is given by:

 </p><p align="center">
 <i>f '</i> = (<i>V + U</i><sub>0</sub>) <i>f</i> / (<i>V -
 U</i><sub>s</sub>)

 </p><p align="justify">
 where <i>V</i> is the speed of sound, <i>U</i><sub>0</sub> the
 observer's velocity, <i>U</i><sub>s</sub> the source velocity, and
 <i>f</i> the source frequency.

 </p><p align="justify">
 <br> (c)  A similar effect for electromagnetic radiation. The
 radiation emitted by a source with a motion component towards the
 observer will have increased frequency: if the source is moving away
 from the observer, the observed frequency is reduced. This has great
 significance in astronomy. Thus the Doppler effect on radar pulses
 reflected by the planets gives information on their rotation. The
 displacement of lines in the spectra of stars and galaxies (i.e. the
 red shift or the blue shift) can tell the astronomer how these bodies
 are moving.
 <br> For electromagnetic radiation the theory of the effect is not the same
 as for sound. This is because there is no fixed medium to give a frame
 of reference. Relativity theory gives the following result:

 </p><p align="center">
 <i>v</i> = <i>v</i><sub>0</sub> {[(1 - <i>v / c</i>) / (1 + <i>v /
 c</i>)]}<sup>1/2</sup>

 </p><p align="justify">
 Here <i>v</i> is the observed frequency, <i>v</i><sub>0</sub> is the
 emitted frequency; <i>v</i> is the speed of separation of source and

 compared to <i>c</i> the expression simplifies to:

 redshifted. The Doppler shift allows astronomers to measure the radial
 velocities of stars. The Doppler shift is not responsible for the
 redshifts that most galaxies exhibit; that is a cosmological
 redshift. <a href="../glossary.html#C95" target="ads_dw">[C95]</a> 
 <br> (b) Change in the apparent wavelength of radiation (e.g.,
 light or sound) emitted by a moving body. A star moving away from the
 observer will appear to be radiating light at a lower frequency than
 if at rest; consequently, lines in the star's spectrum will be shifted
 toward the red (lower frequency) end of the spectrum. The existence of
 a direct relationship between the redshift of light from galaxies and
 their distances is the fundamental evidence for the expansion of the

 some entities

 <br> (a)  Electromagnetic Radiation. Einstein (1905) argued that,
 whereas the propagation of these radiations is fully described by the
 theory of electromagnetic waves, interaction with matter occurs as if
 the radiation travels in packets (photons) each with a quantum of
 energy <i>hv</i>, where <i>h</i> is the Planck constant and <i>v</i>
 is the frequency of the wave. His examples were the Planck radiation
 law, photoelectric emission, and photoionization of gases. The
 principle has been verified for radiations of all wavelengths from
 microwaves to gamma rays, in many different phenomena involving
 emission, absorption or scattering. Whereas such wave properties as
 frequency, phase speed, and electric and magnetic fields are
 measurable quantities, photons are only observable when being created
 or destroyed.
 <br> (b) Particle Waves. In 1924 de Broglie suggested that atomic
 particles might have wave-like properties and that the wavelength
 (λ)
 would have the same relationship to the momentum (<i>p</i>) as applies
 to electromagnetic radiation:
 λ = <i>h / p</i>. This
 concept has been 
 used very successfully in the form of quantum theory called <i>wave
 mechanics</i>. Beams of particles including electrons, neutrons, and
 gas molecules incident on crystals form diffraction patterns analogous
 to those given by x-rays. The wavelength formula is fully verified.
