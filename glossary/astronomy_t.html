 <td valign="top"><b>Scales</b>
 </td><td><p align="justify"><b>Celsius</b>. This mercury-in-glass scale was
 devised as early as 1710 and was 
 used by Linnaes at Uppsala certainly before 1737. The zero of the scale
 represents the melting point of ice and the boiling point of water is
 taken to 
 be 100 degrees. In continental Europe the scale has always been known as the
 Celsius scale in the mistaken belief that it was invented by Anders Celsius
 (1701-1744), whereas Celsius proposed a scale which had zero for the boiling
 point of water and 100 for the melting point of ice. The scale was
 inverted by J. P. Christen (1683-1755) in 1743. In England the scale
 was originally called the Centigrade scale but this name was abandoned
 in favour of Celsius in 1948.
 </p><p align="justify">
 <b>Fahrenheit</b>. This scale was composed by G. D. Fahrenheit (1686-1736)
 between 1710 and 1714. Three fixed temperature points were used - the 
 temperature of an ice and salt mixture, the freezing point of water and
 normal 
 human temperature - which were taken to be 0, 32 and 96 respectively. It is
 mere coincidence that the temperature interval between the freezing
 (32°F) 
 and boiling (212°F) points of water is 180° when expressed in
 the Fahrenheit scale.

 </p><p align="justify">
 <b>Reaumur</b>. An arbitrary scale in which the freezing and boiling
 points of water 
 are taken to be 0 and 80°R respectively. R. A. F. Reaumur (1683-1757)
 deduced his scale in 1730 from the thermal expansion of an alcohol and water
 mixture. When he considered the `length' to be 1000 units at the ice
 point he 
 found that at the boiling point the length had expanded to 1080 units, hence
 the peculiar figure of 80 in his scale.

 </p><p align="justify">
 <b>Thermodynamic</b>. In this use is made of the fact that the
 temperature of a body 
 is considered to be a measure of the average kinetic energy per degree of
 freedom of the constituent molecules. This concept of temperature can be
 applied only to a body consisting of a large number of molecules. For the
 purpose of establishing a scale, two points are used to determine
 it. The first 
 is zero temperature corresponding to zero energy. The second is the
 temperature 
 of the triple point of water (0.0 1°C), i.e. the point at which the
 solid, liquid 
 and gaseous phase of pure water are in equilibrium and this is defined
 as being 
 equal to 273.16 degrees when these are degrees on the Celsius temperature
 scale. The base unit of the thermodynamic scale is the kelvin (K) defined as
 the fraction 1/273.16 of the thermodynamic temperature of the triple
 point of 
 water. Kelvin temperatures represent the same temperature interval as those
 on the Celsius scale and are obtained by adding 273.15 to the Celsius 
 temperature. Also used occasionally to indicate the thermodynamic
 temperature 
 is the degree Rankine (°R), defined as 5/9 of the kelvin. Rankine
 temperatures 
 have the same temperature interval as those on the Fahrenheit scale and are
 obtained by adding 459.69 to the Fahrenheit temperatures. The scales are
 named after Lord Kelvin (1824-1907) and W. J. M. Rankine (1820-1872), 
 both of whom held chairs at Glasgow University and who, along with
 Joule, established the thermodynamic temperature scale in the middle of the
 nineteenth century. In Glazebrook's <i>Dictionary of Applied Physics</i>
 (1923) 
 there is a suggestion that the present Kelvin and Rankine scales should be
 called the tercentesimal (273 <img src="../GIFS/approx.gif" alt="approx">
 300) and quinquentesimal (1460
 <img src="../GIFS/approx.gif" alt="approx"> 500) scales
 respectively. The Kelvin scale is also called the Absolute scale. In
 1968 the 
 CGPM decided to replace the term degree Kelvin (°K) by the single word
 kelvin, for which the abbreviation is K.

 <b>International Temperature Scale (ITS-90)</b>. This scale was
 introduced in 1927 
 to overcome the practical difficulties of the direct realization of
 temperature 
 by gas thermometry and to provide a practical temperature scale which could
 be easily and accurately reproduced. Initially it had six fixed points,
 but these 
 were increased at its revision in 1948. The scale was reissued as the
 <b> International 
 Practical Scale (IPTS-68)</b> in 1968 when its lowest fixed point was
 reduced from 54.261°K (the triple point of oxygen) to 13.81°K (the
 triple point 
 of hydrogen). However, its upper limit remained unchanged at 1064.43°C
 (1337.58°K), the freezing point of gold. Between these two limits
 there were nine accurately defined fixed points, one of which is the
 triple point of water, 
 0.01°C. The scale was revised in 1975 and, in 1989, the CIPM
 approved the 
 issue of a new scale to be known as the International Temperature Scale
 (ITS-90). This covers temperatures from 0.65°K to the highest
 temperatures practicably measurable in terms of the Planck radiation
 law using monochromatic 
 radiation. Between these two limits there are 17 fixed points. Temperatures 
 below 5°K are defined in terms of the vapour pressures of <sup>3</sup>He
 and <sup>4</sup>He 
 and the fixed points between 5°K and the triple point of water are
 marked by the °
 triple points of certain elements, e.g. neon (24.5561 K). Those above
 0.01°C 
 are defined with reference to the freezing points of specified metallic
 elements, 
 one of which is gold. However, in the ITS-90 scale this is given as
 1064.18°C, 
 which is 0.25°C less than specified in the IPTS-68 scale. Finally,
 the unit of 
 the fundamental physical quantity known as thermodynamic temperature is
 defined as the kelvin (K), which is given as 1/273.16 of thermodynamic 
 temperature of the triple point of water. Furthermore, ITS-90 gives the
 relationship 
 between the thermodynamic and the Celsius scales as
 <i>t</i><sub>90</sub> = <i>T</i><sub>90</sub> - 273.16, where 
 <i>T</i><sub>90</sub> and <i>t</i><sub>90</sub> are in kelvins and
 degrees Celsius respectively.

 <br> (b) A simple theoretical description of the early
 universe is possible because the primordial soup had time to reach
 thermal equilibrium, the state for which the relative abundances of
 different constituents is determined not by the initial conditions,
 but instead by the criterion that the production and annihilation
 rates for any particular constituent are in balance. As long as there
 are reactions that can convert one constituent to another, the ratios
 of those two constituents will be determined by thermal equilibrium.
 For example, protons and neutrons can interconvert by the reactions
 </p><p>
 proton + electron &lt;-&gt; neutron + neutrino,
 </p><p align="justify">where the double arrow
 indicates that either the left-hand side or the right-hand side can
 represent the initial particles. If we imagine that the universe began
 with only protons, then this reaction would cause some to convert to
 neutrons. As the density of neutrons increased, the rate at which
 neutrons are converted back to protons would increase. The reactions
 would continue until there were just enough neutrons so that the
 number of neutrons converting to protons each second would equal the
 number of protons converting to neutrons. As another example, thermal
 equilibrium implies that the photons in the early universe did not
 have some arbitrary distribution, but were instead described by the
 intensity and spectrum of black body radiation. <a href="../glossary.html#G97" target="ads_dw">[G97]</a>
