<td valign="top"><b>Aberration</b>
</td><td><p align="justify">(a) Defect in the image formed by a lens, mirror
or optical 
system. Spherical aberration results when different rays of light are
brought to more than one focus, producing a blurred image or
<i>coma</i>; chromatic aberration when different wavelengths within a
ray of light are brought to more than one focus, producing an image
distorted by colored fringes. Aberration in lenses can be overcome
by the use of an <i>achromatic lens</i> or a combination of lenses
made of glasses of different <i>refractive indices</i>.
<a href="../glossary.html#A84" target="ads_dw">[A84]</a>
<br>(b) The apparent angular displacement of the observed
position of a 
celestial object from its 
geometric position, caused by the finite
velocity of light in combination with the motions of the observer and
of the observed object. see <b>Aberration, Planetary</b>
<a href="../glossary.html#S92" target="ads_dw">[S92]</a>
</p></td></tr><tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Aberration</b>
</td><td><p align="justify">A defect in an optical system such that the image is
not a true picture of the object. For instance, colored fringes may
appear, the image may not be focused, or the shape may show
distortion. Techniques of aberration correction exist; these can,
however, be complex and costly.
<br> <i>Chromatic (color) Aberration</i> is found with a single lens;
mirrors do not suffer from chromatic aberration. Because dispersion
always accompanies refractive deviation, the `red' image will be
farther from the lens than the `blue'. Consequently, the image is
surrounded by colored fringes. Chromatic aberration is corrected by
forming a compound lens, whose elements have different refractive
constants.
<br> <i>Spherical Aberration</i> always occurs with rays that are distant
from the axis and incident on a spherical mirror or lens. It is the
cause of the caustic curve. Spherical aberration is corrected by using
parabolic reflecting and refracting surfaces.
<br> <i>Astigmatism</i> affects rays neither close nor parallel to the
axis. The cone of rays through a lens from an off-axis object does not
focus at a point. Instead, two images in the form of short lines are
formed at different distances from the lens. Between the two the image
appears blurred. Mirrors forming images of off-axis points show a
similar defect. The best method of minimizing astigmatism is to reduce
the aperture with stops, thus allowing light only through the center
of the lens.
<br> <i>Coma</i> is rather similar in cause, effect, and correction to
astigmatism. After refraction by a lens, a cone of rays from an
off-axis object tends to have a tadpole-shaped section because of coma.
<br> <i>Distortion</i> is the result of differences in a lens' magnifying
power between different axes. Reduction of aperture is the normal
solution to both coma and distortion.

</td><td><p align="justify">(a)  The SI unit is the meter per

motion in one dimension, and in unscientific usage, acceleration means
rate of increase of speed. This is a scalar quantity, which can be
positive or negative. Negative values mean that the speed is
decreasing and may be called deceleration or retardation. <b>2.</b>
In scientific study of motion in two or three dimensions acceleration
means rate of change of velocity; <i>a = dv / dt</i>. This is a vector
quantity having magnitude (which is always positive) and
direction. Whenever speed changes (increasing or decreasing), or
direction changes, or both speed and direction change, this is an
acceleration.

that of light the mass of the particles increases dramatically, adding
greatly to the energy released on impact. The resulting explosion
promotes the production of exotic particles, which are analyzed
according to their behavior as they fly away through a particle
detector. <a href="../glossary.html#F88" target="ads_dw">[F88]</a>

electrically 
charged particles (electrons, protons, and their antiparticles) to higher 
energies. If accelerators are linear, they need to be very long to
achieve the

they can always annihilate to form gamma rays. The antiparticle of an

neutrons). <a href="../glossary.html#G97" target="ads_dw">[G97]</a>

<br> (d) A particle of the same mass and spin, but opposite

example, a proton and antiproton both have mass 1836 times that of an
electron and spin ½ unit, but the charge on the proton is + 1
unit, while that on the antiproton is -1 unit. For unstable particles,
such as an isolated neutron, the particle and antiparticle have the
same half-life. For uncharged particles the antiparticle is indicated
by a bar above the symbol, such as
<img src="../New_Gifs/nbar.gif" alt="n bar"> for the antineutron. For
charged 
particles the distinction is indicated by the sign, for example, e+ is
the positron, the antiparticle of an electron. Antiparticles of
fermions are subject to a conservation law according to which new
particles can only be created in particle-antiparticle pairs, while
particles can be destroyed only by annihilation with their
antiparticles. This rule does not apply to bosons. see also

particle with the same mass but all charges opposite. If a particle has
no charges, such as the 
photon, it is its own antiparticle. Often the antiparticle is denoted

<br>(b) The building block of matter. The nucleus of an
atom consists of 
one or more protons and may contain neutrons as well; any electrons
surround the nucleus. The number of protons in the atom - the atomic
number - determines the element. <a href="../glossary.html#C95" target="ads_dw">[C95]</a>
<br> (c) The smallest part of an element that can take part
in a 
chemical reaction. Atoms consist of a small dense positively charged
nucleus, made up of neutrons and protons, with electrons in a cloud
around this nucleus. The chemical reactions of an element are
determined by the number of electrons (which is equal to the number of
protons in the nucleus). All atoms of a given element have the same
number of protons (the proton number). A given element may have two or
more isotopes, which differ in the number of neutrons in the nucleus.
<br> The electrons surrounding the nucleus are grouped into <i>shells</i> -
i.e. main orbits 
around the nucleus. Within these main orbits there may be
sub-shells. These correspond 
to atomic orbitals. An electron in an atom is specified by four quantum
numbers: 
<br> 1. The <i>principal quantum number (n)</i> can have values 1, 2,
etc. The corresponding shells are denoted by letters K, L, M, etc.,
the K shell (<i>n</i> = 1) being the nearest to the nucleus. The
maximum number of electrons in a given shell is
2<i>n</i><sup>2</sup>. This quantum number has the largest effect on
the energies of the states; high values of <i>n</i> correspond to
weakly bound (higher energy) electrons.
<br> 2. The <i>orbital quantum number (l)</i>, which specifies the angular
momentum. For a given value of <i>n, l</i> can have possible values of
<i>n</i>-1, <i>n</i>-2,... 2, 1, 0. For instance, the M shell
(<i>n</i> = 3) has three sub-shells with different values of <i>l</i>
(0, 1, and 2). Sub-shells with angular momentum, 0, 1, 2, and 3 are
designated by letters s, p, d, and f. This quantum number has the
second largest effect on the energies; higher values of <i>l</i> give
moderately higher energy electrons.
<br> 3. The <i>magnetic quantum number (m)</i>. This can have values <i>-l,
-(l</i> - 1) ... 0 ... +(<i>l</i> + 1), + <i>l</i>. It determines the
orientation of the electron orbital in a magnetic field. States with
the same values of <i>n</i> and <i>l</i> but different values of
<i>m</i> have the same energy in the absence of a magnetic field, but
differ slightly when a field is applied.
<br> 4. The <i>spin quantum number (m</i><sub>s</sub>), which specifies the
intrinsic angular momentum of the electron. It can have values +½
and -½. Quantum states in which the spin is parallel to the
orbital angular momentum are at slightly higher energy than ones in
which it is antiparallel. This results, for example, in the fact that
the yellow light from a sodium lamp has two very close lines in its
spectrum.
<br> Each electron in the atom has four quantum numbers and, according to
the Pauli exclusion principle, no two electrons can have the same set
of quantum numbers. This explains the electronic structure of atoms. <a href="../glossary.html#DC99" target="ads_dw">[DC99]</a>
<br> (c) An atom has a nucleus surrounded by electrons bound together
by the 
electromagnetic force. Ninety-two different atoms occur naturally, making
ninety-two different chemical elements, with nuclei having one to
ninety-two protons. The atoms are electrically neutral. The diameter of
an atom is about 10,000 times larger than the diameter of its

of 1 amu is 931 MeV. <a href="../glossary.html#H76" target="ads_dw">[H76]</a>
<br> (c) The masses of atoms and molecules are generally
given in atomic mass units. 
These units are based on a scale in which the mass of the carbon isotope
<sup>12</sup><sub>6</sub>C is taken to be 12. This makes one atomic mass
unit equivalent to 
1.6605402 × 10<sup>-27</sup> kg. The unit is sometimes called a
dalton. Atomic masses 
were originally given as atomic weights on a scale where the mass of the
hydrogen atom was unity. In 1885 Ostwald suggested if atomic weights were
expressed on a scale in which the mass of oxygen was 16, more of the
elements 
would have integral numbers for their atomic weights. The discovery of
oxygen isotopes led to the adoption of two atomic weight
scales[27]. The one 
used by chemists was based on the figure 16 representing the average
mass of 
the oxygen atom in its natural state
(<sup>16</sup>O:<sup>18</sup>O:<sup>17</sup>O in the abundance 
506:1:0.204), whereas that used by the physicists considered the oxygen 
isotope <sup>16</sup>O as the basic unit on their scale. The ratio of
atomic mass on the 
physical scale to atomic mass on the oxygen chemical scale[28] was
1.000272±0.00005.

In 1960[29] the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics followed
the proposal made a year earlier by the International Union of Pure and
Applied Chemistry that all atomic weights should be based on the
<sup>12</sup><sub>6</sub>C scale. 
This enabled more isotopes to have integral mass numbers than would have
been possible on the oxygen scale. This reduced the values given on the
previous chemical scale by a factor of 1.000043 and changed the values
of the 
Faraday and Avogadro's constant by a similar amount. Values on the physical
scale can be converted to the new scale by multiplying by 0.999685. <a href="../glossary.html#JM92" target="ads_dw">[JM92]</a>

</td><td><p align="justify">(a) A mechanical system may be such that its dynamical
evolution causes it to approach a stable end-state. In the phase space
representing the system, the representative point tends to a fixed set
of points called an attractor. The attractor may be a point, a line,
or a fractal. <a href="../glossary.html#D89" target="ads_dw">[D89]</a>
<br> (b) The point or set of points in phase space to which a
changing system moves with time. The idea of an attractor for a system
comes from chaos theory. The attractor of a system may be a single
point (in which case the system reaches a fixed state that is
independent of time). Alternatively, it may be a closed curve, known
as a <i>limit cycle.</i> This is the type of behavior found in
oscillating systems. In some systems, the attractor is a curve that is
not closed and does not repeat itself. This, known as a <i>strange
attractor</i>, is characteristic of chaotic systems. see also<b>
