 <br>(b) A theory which postulates that, at

 expansion, in response to the separation of the strong nuclear force
 from the electroweak force. This idea solves the flatness and horizon

 vacuum. Although the inflation would occur in far less than a second,
 it could account for the "bang" of the big bang theory, it could
 explain the origin of essentially all the matter in the observed
 universe, and it can solve the horizon problem and the flatness

<br> 
 (a) A cosmological model in which the Universe
 underwent an epoch of extraordinarily rapid expansion within the first
 10<sup>-30</sup> s or so after the big bang; in a typical version, the
 diameter of the Universe increased by a factor at least 10<sup>25</sup>
 times larger (or 
 perhaps much larger still) than had been previously thought; the model
 was proposed by A.H. Guth in 1981, but the original formulation
 contained a crucial flaw which was remedied by the development of the
 new inflationary universe model in 1982 by A.D. Linde, and by A.
 Albrecht and P. Steinhardt (see new inflationary universe). <a href="../glossary.html#D89" target="ads_dw">[D89]</a>
<br> 
 (b) A recent modification of the standard big
 bang model in which the infant universe went through a brief period of
 extremely rapid (exponential) expansion, after which it settled back
 into the more leisurely rate of expansion of the standard model. The
 period of rapid expansion began and ended when the universe was still
 much less than a second old, yet it provides a physical explanation
 for the flatness and horizon puzzles. The inflationary universe model
 also suggests that the universe is vastly larger than the portion of
 it that is visible to us. (See exponential expansion.) <a href="../glossary.html#LB90" target="ads_dw">[LB90]</a>

 </td><td><p align="justify">A mutual effect between two or more systems or
 bodies, so that the overall result is not simply the sum of the
 separate effects. There are four separate interactions distinguished
 in physics:
 <br>
 1. <i>Gravitational Interaction</i> The weakest of the four, about
 10<sup>40</sup> times weaker than the electromagnetic interaction. It
 is an interaction between bodies or particles on account of their
 mass, and operates over long distances.
 <br>
 2. <i>Electromagnetic interaction</i> The interaction between charged
 bodies or particles (stationary or moving). It falls off with the
 square of distance and operates over all distances.
 <br>
 3. <i>Strong interaction</i> An interaction between hadrons, about 100
 times greater than the electromagnetic interaction. It operates at
 very short range (up to around 10<sup>-15</sup> m) and is the force
 responsible for holding nucleons together in the atomic nucleus.
 <br>
 4. <i>Weak interaction</i> An interaction about 10<sup>10</sup> times
 weaker than the electromagnetic interaction. It occurs between
 leptons, and is the interaction in beta decay.
 <br>
 So far it has not proved possible to formulate a unified field theory
 for all four types of interaction, although there has been some
 success in unifying the electromagnetic and weak interactions. <a href="../glossary.html#DC99" target="ads_dw">[DC99]</a>
<br> 
 (a) Event involving an exchange between two or more
 particles. Since the fundamental forces are portrayed by quantum
 theory as involving the exchange of force-carrying particles (the
 bosons), the forces are more correctly described as interactions. <a href="../glossary.html#F88" target="ads_dw">[F88]</a>
 <br>
 (b) There are four known kinds of interactions
 between particles. In 
 the order of decreasing strength they are the strong interactions
 (effective only to distances of about 3 fermis); electromagnetic
 interactions, which are the interactions of charged particles with
 electromagnetic fields; weak interactions, responsible for <img src="../GIFS/beta2.gif" alt="beta" align="middle">-decay; and
 gravitational interactions, the weakest of all. The pion is associated
 with the strong interactions; the photon, with electromagnetic
 interactions; the neutrino, with weak interactions; and the graviton,
 with gravitational interactions. If gravitational = 1, then weak =
 10<sup>28</sup>, electromagnetic = 10<sup>39</sup>,
 strong = 10<sup>41</sup>. <a href="../glossary.html#H76" target="ads_dw">[H76]</a>
<br> 
 (c) Particle physicists use the word "interaction"
 to refer to anything that particles can do, which includes decaying,
 scattering, and annihilating. The known interactions of nature are
 divided into four classes, which from the weakest to the strongest are
 gravitation, the weak interactions, electromagnetism, and the strong
 interactions. <a href="../glossary.html#G97" target="ads_dw">[G97]</a>

 </td><td><p align="justify">When similar waves with a regular phase
 relationship pass through the same region they are said to
 <i>interfere</i>. The resultant displacement at any point is the sum
 of the individual displacements, taking into account their directions
 and phases. The waves emerge from the overlapping region
 unaffected. The combination of such coherent waves is to be contrasted
 with the combination of incoherent waves, for example light from two
 lamps falling on a surface, where the resultant intensity is just the
 sum of the separate intensities.
 <br>
 There are two simple cases. If the waves travel in the same or very
 nearly the same direction, interference fringes are produced. If waves
 of comparable intensity travel in opposite directions stationary waves
 are produced. In all other cases, a complex system of interference
 fringes and stationary waves is caused, which does not admit simple
 analysis or description.
 <br>
 Interference fringes can be observed with all types of waves. They can
 be understood most easily by considering waves from just two sources
 but the ideas can then be generalized to more complicated systems. The
 two sources must give waves of the same frequency and with a regular
 phase relationship. This is easily achieved using sources of sound,
 ripples or radiowaves but in optics it is normally necessary to derive
 the two sources from one original source by division of wavefront or
 division of amplitude. The first method is used in Young's double
 slit, Fresnel's biprism, and Lloyd's mirror. The second is used in
 Newton's rings, the air wedge, and thin films.
 <br>
 Interference fringes are normally observed at a distance from the
 sources that is very large compared with their separation. Thus the
 waves travel in almost exactly the same direction and, if the sources
 are equal, they have equal intensity. There are then maxima of
 intensity (light fringes) where the path difference is zero or an
 integral number of wavelengths, and minima (dark fringes) where the
 path difference is an odd number of half wavelengths.

 motion which depends on whether the interfering waves are in step (in

 one. High temperature is particularly conducive to ionization. <a href="../glossary.html#A84" target="ads_dw">[A84]</a> 
<br> 
 (b) The process of producing ions. There are several
 ways in which ions may be formed from atoms or molecules. In certain
 chemical reactions ionization occurs by transfer of electrons; for
 example, sodium atoms and chlorine atoms react to form sodium
 chloride, which consists of sodium ions (Na<sup>+</sup>) and chloride
 ions (Cl<sup>-</sup>). Certain molecules can ionize in solution;
 acids, for example, form hydrogen ions as in the reaction

 the electrons they eject from substances by the photoelectric effect

 individual molecules by the photoelectric effect, but the ejected
 electrons have insufficient kinetic energy to cause further ionization
 unless an electric field is applied.
 <br>
 At ordinary intensities electromagnetic radiation with quantum energy
 below the ionization potential cannot cause ionization. But by
 focusing laser beams it is possible to ionize matter - even when the
 individual photons have energy less than a hundredth of the ionization
 potential. Such radiations are not ordinarily classified as ionizing

 otherwise increase its temperature (for example by compressing it) it
 is possible to keep the temperature constant by heat transfer from the
 body. Conversely a body may expand doing external work, while heat is
 transferred to it to prevent the temperature from falling. In the case
 of an ideal gas, for which the internal energy depends only on the
 temperature, the heat transferred from the substance must be exactly
 equal to the work done on it. For real substances the work and heat
 may not balance in an isothermal process since the internal energy may
 depend also on the volume.
 <br>
 Although no real process can be perfectly isothermal there are many
 phenomena that approximate very closely to it. Perfectly reversible
 isothermal volume changes of an ideal gas are assumed in thermodynamic
 analyzes, for example Kelvin based his thermodynamic temperature scale
 upon the behavior of an ideal gas in a Carnot cycle.
 <br>
 Isothermal changes are contrasted with adiabatic changes in which no
 heat enters or leaves the system so any work done on or by it changes
 the internal energy and hence the temperature. <i>See</i> adiabatic
