 only by the weak force and gravity. It was first postulated by Pauli
 in 1930 to ensure conservation of energy and angular momentum in
 nuclear <img src="../GIFS/beta2.gif" alt="beta" align="middle">
 decay. Three different types of neutrinos are known to exist 
 corresponding to the three massive leptons: <img src="../GIFS/nu.gif" alt="nu"><sub>e</sub>, <img src="../GIFS/nu.gif" alt="nu"><sub>µ</sub> and <img src="../GIFS/nu.gif" alt="nu"><sub><img src="../GIFS/tau.gif" alt="tau"></sub>. <a href="../glossary.html#CD99" target="ads_dw">[CD99]</a>
 <br> 
 (d) A fundamental elementary particle with no electric
 charge and 
 very small if any rest mass. Believed to be exceedingly abundant in the
 Universe. The neutrino has a very low cross-section for interaction with
 matter and is almost impossible to detect, hence the uncertainty over
 its rest mass. The Sun produces neutrinos from thermonuclear reactions
 in its core, and a large flux of neutrinos carries away most of the
 energy, of a supernova. Neutrinos are one candidate for Dark Matter.
 Experiments to detect cosmic neutrinos involve large masses of
 "stopping" material and indirect detection of the effects of neutrino
 absorption. <a href="../glossary.html#McL97" target="ads_dw">[McL97]</a>
 <br> 
 (e) A stable particle with no charge, a rest mass of zero, and 
 a spin of 1/2, that carries away energy in the course of nuclear
 reactions. Its main characteristic is the weakness of its interactions
 with all other particles. Since the wavelengths of neutrinos 
 at the energies at which they are normally emitted from unstable
 nuclei are only a few thousandths of an angstrom (compared
 with the wavelength of a light photon which is several thousand
 angstroms), they have negligible probability (10<sup>-19</sup> that of
 a light photon) of interacting with matter and escape at the speed of
 light. Neutrinos arise only in the energy-producing regions of
 stars and therefore, unlike light photons, provide direct evidence
 of conditions in stellar cores. There are two types of neutrinos,
 those associated with electrons (<i>v<sub>e</sub></i>) and those
 associated with muons (<i>v</i><sub>µ</sub>). <a href="../glossary.html#H76" target="ads_dw">[H76]</a>

 known varieties, one in each generation of particles, associated with
 electron, muon, and tau leptons. It only takes part in weak
 interactions.<a href="../glossary.html#D89" target="ads_dw">[D89]</a>

 electron; the process occurs in reverse during the formation of a
 neutron star. <a href="../glossary.html#A84" target="ads_dw">[A84]</a>
 <br> 
 (b) One of the constituents of the atomic nucleus
 discovered in 1932. It 
 is bound into atomic nuclei by the strong nuclear force. Free neutrons
 decay slowly via the weak nuclear force. Despite being electrically
 neutral, the neutron possesses both an electric dipole moment (as if
 it were made of positive and negative charges separated a minute
 distance) and a magnetic moment, indicating some internal
 substructure. <a href="../glossary.html#CD99" target="ads_dw">[CD99]</a>
 <br> 
 (c) A baryon made of one up quark and two down
 quarks. It possesses no 
 electromagnetic charge and can only be found in atomic nuclei. [c97]
 <br> 
 (d) A nuclear particle with zero charge and with a mass slightly 
 greater than that of a proton (mass of the neutron is 1.008665 amu =
 1.6749 × 10<sup>-24</sup> g). A free neutron decays, after a
 half-life of 
 about 10.6 minutes, into a proton, an electron, and an
 antineutrino. The neutron is probably made up of still more
 fundamental particles having both positive and negative charges. The 
 charges balance to give a net charge of zero, but the motions of
 the charges are such that their magnetic contributions do not
 cancel and consequently the neutron is magnetic. <a href="../glossary.html#H76" target="ads_dw">[H76]</a>

 (e) Chargeless particle, typically found in the
 nucleus of an atom, 
 consisting of three quarks (two down-quarks, one up-quark). <a href="../glossary.html#G99" target="ads_dw">[G99]</a>
 <br> 
 (f) Electrically neutral, massive particles found in the
 nuclei of atoms. Each neutron is composed of one up quark and two
 down quarks; its mass is 939.6 MeV, slightly more than that of the
 proton. Stable within the nucleus, the neutron if isolated decays,
 with a ha half-life of fifteen minutes. <a href="../glossary.html#F88" target="ads_dw">[F88]</a>
 <br> 
 (g) Free neutrons have a lifetime of about fifteen minutes; the
 y decay into a
 proton, an electron, and an antineutrino. When the neutrons are bound
 into nuclei (such as those in us), the decays are no longer possible
 because 
 of subtle effects explained by quantum theory, so the neutrons in nuclei
 are as stable as protons. see also <b> Hadron</b> <a href="../glossary.html#K2000" target="ads_dw">[K2000]</a>

 10<sup>13</sup>-10<sup>15</sup> g cm<sup>-3</sup>. Under current
 theories pulsars are assumed to be rotating magnetic neutron stars. A

 are magnetized rotating neutron stars and X-ray binaries consist of a

 increasing its luminosity by as much as 14 mag. (Since 1925 novae 
 have been given variable star designations.) Novae are old
 disk-population stars. Unlike supernovae, novae retain their stellar 
 form and most of their substance after the outburst. All known
 common novae are found in close binary systems with one component a
 cool red giant and the other a hot, less massive object 
 which is the seat of the instability. <a href="../glossary.html#H76" target="ads_dw">[H76]</a>

 (c) A stars that undergoes an explosion during
 which its brightness 
 increases by up to ten magnitudes. Usually the following phases are
 distinguished (in order of time): pre-maximum, principal, diffuse
 enhanced, Orion, nebular and post-nova. <a href="../glossary.html#JJ95" target="ads_dw">[JJ95]</a>

 nuclear force and the weak nuclear force. These two forces, plus the
 gravitational and electromagnetic forces, comprise the four
 fundamental forces of nature. The strong nuclear force, which is the
 strongest of all four forces, is the force that holds protons and
 neutrons together in the atomic nucleus. The weak nuclear force is
 responsible for certain kinds of radioactivity; for example, the
 disintegration of a neutron into a proton, electron, and
 antineutrino. <a href="../glossary.html#LB90" target="ads_dw">[LB90]</a>

 (b) Although protons and neutrons carry no strong (or color) ch
 arge, at tiny
 distances near a proton or neutron, the cancellation of the strong field
 from its constituent quarks and gluons is incomplete, leaving a residual
 strong force that leaks outside the proton and neutron. This is the nuclear
 force that binds protons and neutrons into nuclei. <a href="../glossary.html#K2000" target="ads_dw">[K2000]</a>

 <br> 
 (b) The production of heavy nuclei from the fusion of
 lighter ones. According to the big bang theory, the infant Universe
 consisted of only hydrogen, the lightest of all atomic nuclei,
 because any heavier nuclei would have come apart in the intense heat.
 All other elements would have to be formed later, in nucleosynthesis
 processes. It is believed that most of the helium, the next lightest
 element after hydrogen, was formed when the Universe was a few minutes
 old, and that most of the other elements were made much later, in
 nuclear reactions at the centers of stars. <a href="../glossary.html#LB90" target="ads_dw">[LB90]</a>

 (c) The nuclear processes by which the chemical elements
 are synthesized. The principal sites for these processes are the
 central regions of stars where the temperatures are sufficiently high
 for the synthesis of, for example, helium from protons and neutrons or
 carbon from three helium nuclei to take place. Other forms of
 nucleosynthesis include explosive nucleosynthesis which takes place
 during supernova outbursts and primordial nucleosynthesis in which
 light elements are synthesized during the hot early phases of the hot

 <br>
 (d) Although protons and neutrons are color-neutral composites 
 of quarks
 and gluons, the quarks and gluons are not all at the same places, so some
 of their color (or strong) fields exist outside the proton or neutron,
 giving an attractive force that binds protons and neutrons into
 nuclei. The attractive effects of this residual color force are offset
 by the electrical repulsion of the protons, so nuclei with too many
 protons cannot exist. It turns out that there are ninety-two stable or
 long-lived nuclei in nature. They are the nuclei of the atoms of the
 ninety-two chemical elements. <a href="../glossary.html#K2000" target="ads_dw">[K2000]</a>
