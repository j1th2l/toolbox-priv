 </td><td><p align="justify">The capture of neutrons on a very rapid time
 scale (i.e., one

 advanced to account for the existence of all elements heavier
 than bismuth (up to <i>A</i> <img src="../GIFS/approx.gif" alt="approx"> 298) as well as the neutron-rich isotopes heavier than
 iron. The essential feature of the <i>r</i>-process is 
 the release of great numbers of neutrons in a very short time
 (less than 100 seconds). The presumed source for such a large
 flux of neutrons is a supernova, at the boundary between the
 collapsing neutron star and the ejected material. However, other
 proposed sources have included such things as supernova shocks
 and black-hole-neutron-star collisions. The heavier <i>r</i>-process
 elements are synthesized at a temperature of about 10<sup>9</sup> K and an 
 assumed neutron density of 10<sup>20</sup>-10<sup>30</sup> per
 cm<sup>3</sup>. The <i>r</i>-process is 
 terminated by neutron-induced fission. The existence of <sup>244</sup>Pu
 (half-life 82 million years) in the early solar system shows that at
 least one <i>r</i>-process event had occurred in the Galaxy just before

 away from us (although the galaxy is moving away from us) but because
 of the expansion of the universe. As a galaxy emits a light wave
 toward us, the light wave travels through the fabric of space; en

 conditions for the occurrence of turbulence in fluids. [H76
 <br> 
 (b) The Reynolds number is one of the more important of
 the non-dimensional 
 parameters of fluid motion. In 1883 Osborne Reynolds (1842-1912) showed the
 flow of a fluid in a tube could be described by a dimensionless
 constant. 
 This constant, which is now called Reynolds' number, is given by
 <i>vl</i> / <img src="../GIFS/nu.gif" alt="nu">, where
 <i>l</i> has the dimensions of length, <i>v</i> is the fluid velocity
 and <img src="../GIFS/nu.gif" alt="nu"> is the kinematic 
 viscosity. Subsequent work has extended Reynolds' ideas to all cases of
 fluids 
 in motion. In general low values of <i>Re</i> show that the viscous
 forces are  
 predominant in controlling the flow whereas higher values indicate that the
 inertial forces are more important.
 <br>
 When the fluid is moving through a curved pipe its flow continues to be
 governed by the Reynolds number, but in this case its numerical value is
 changed 
 by taking into account the ratio of cross section (<i>R</i>) and of
 curvature (<i>r</i>) of the 
 tube. This derived constant is sometimes called the Dean number and is equal
 to 1/2<i>Re(R/r)</i><sup>1/2</sup>. 
 <br>
 The movement of a fluid between two rotating cylinders of radii
 <i>R</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>R</i><sub>2</sub> 
 may be described by a dimensionless constant based on Reynolds' number and
 known as the Taylor number (<i>Ta</i>), where <i>Ta =
