 <td valign="top"><b>Galaxy</b> 
 </td><td><p align="justify">(a) Vast system of celestial objects, typically
 consisting of 
 between 10<sup>6</sup> and 10<sup>12</sup> stars, plus interstellar
 gas and dust. There are 
 three basic types: spiral (further subdivided into normal spirals and
 spirals with a "bar" at the centre, and yet further subdivided
 according to the "openness" of the spiral arms), elliptical (subdivided
 according to ellipticity) and irregular (subdivided according to
 whether they are made up of Population I or Population II
 stars). Another not uncommon type of galaxy is a lenticular form
 mid-way between the spiral and the elliptical. <a href="../glossary.html#A84" target="ads_dw">[A84]</a>

 Galaxy". <a href="../glossary.html#C95" target="ads_dw">[C95]</a>
 <br> 
 (c) A large aggregation of stars, bound together
 gravitationally. There are three major classifications of
 galaxies - spiral, elliptical, and irregular - and several
 subclassifications. The sun belongs to a spiral galaxy, the Milky Way
 galaxy. <a href="../glossary.html#F88" target="ads_dw">[F88]</a>

 (d) A large (10<sup>8</sup>-10<sup>13</sup>

 <br> 
 (e) An isolated aggregation of stars and gas, held
 together by 
 their mutual gravity. A typical galaxy has about 100 billion stars,
 has a total mass equal to about a trillion times the mass of the sun,
 is about 100,000 light years in diameter, and is separated from the
 nearest galaxy by a distance of about 100 times its own
 diameter. Thus, galaxies are islands of stars in space. Our galaxy is
 called the Milky Way. Galaxies come in two major shapes: flattened
 disks with a central bulge, called spirals, and amorphous,
 semispherical blobs, called ellipticals. If galaxies are found bunched
 up next to each other, they are said to lie in groups or
 clusters. Clusters with a particularly large number of galaxies in
 them are called rich clusters. Galaxies that do not lie in such groups
 but rather seem to be scattered uniformly and randomly through space
 are called field galaxies. Some galaxies are characterized by the
 dominant type of radiation they emit. For example, radio galaxies are
 unusually strong emitters of radio waves. <a href="../glossary.html#LB90" target="ads_dw">[LB90]</a>
 <br> 
 (f) System of approximately 100,000 million stars, of
 which our Sun 
 is one. It is a normal spiral galaxy of class Sb, with a diameter now
 reckoned to be probably less than 100,000 light-years, and a strong but
 obscure energy source at the center (emitting infrared radiation). It
 is undergoing galactic rotation. Possibly one tenth of the galaxy's
 total mass - estimated at 1.8 × 10<sup>11</sup> solar masses -
 comprises interstellar gas and dust. <a href="../glossary.html#A84" target="ads_dw">[A84]</a>

 of which is in the form of gas and dust. Diameter ~ 30 kpc; thickness
 of nuclear bulge about 4 kpc; thickness of disk about 700-800 pc;
 distance between spiral arms about 1.4 kpc. <i>M<sub>v</sub></i> = -
 20.5. Mean density about 0.1 <i>M</i><sub><img src="../GIFS/smsun.gif" alt="smsun"></sub> per cubic

 The name gauss has been applied to several magnetic units. In Clark's
 dictionary (1891) it is given as the unit of magnetic field strength and
 was equal to 10<sup>8</sup> CGS units. In 1895 the British Association
 allocated 
 the name to the CGS unit of magnetomotive force but five years later
 the IEC adopted the gauss for the CGS unit of magnetizing force. <i>H</i>

 1930 the

 the CGS unit of magnetic flux density, the unit it represents today. The

 Galaxies,</b> represent the biggest single objects in the Universe,

 understood. GRGs are of special interest for several reasons: The
 lobes of radio sources can compress cold gas clumps and trigger star
 or even dwarf galaxy formation, they can also transport gas from a
 host galaxy to large distances and seed the IGM with magnetic
 fields. Since GRGs are larger in size than normal radio galaxies by
 anywhere from 10 to 100 times, their influence on the ambient medium
 is correspondingly wider and is pronounced on scales comparable to
 those of clusters of galaxies or larger. GRGs could therefore play an
 important role in the process of large-scale structure formation in
 the Universe.

 <td valign="top"><b>Group Theory</b> 
 </td><td><p align="justify">The branch of mathematics which describes
 symmetry. A mathematical 
 group <b>G</b> is defined as a collection of elements {<i>a</i>,
 <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>,....}
 with the properties:
 </p><p align="justify"> 
 (1) if <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are in group <b>G</b>, then the product
 of the two elements, <i>ab</i>, is also in <b>G</b>
 </p><p align="justify">
 (2) there is a unit element <i>e</i> such that <i>ae</i> = <i>a</i> for
 all elements <i>a</i> in <b>G</b>; 
 </p><p align="justify">
 (3) each element <i>a</i> has an inverse <i>a</i><sup>-1</sup> such
 that <i>aa</i><sup>-1</sup> = <i>e</i>. 
 </p><p align="justify"> 
 So, for instance, the rotations of an (<i>x, y</i>) coordinate system about
 the <i>z</i>-axis form a group, since the effect of two rotations
 <img src="../GIFS/theta.gif" alt="theta"><sub>1</sub><img src="../GIFS/theta.gif" alt="theta"><sub>2</sub> is
 equivalent to the effect of one big rotation <img src="../GIFS/theta.gif" alt="theta"><sub>3</sub>. Such a group is
 called a continuous group as the angles of rotation can vary
 continuously.
 </p><p align="justify">
 In general, the elements of a group may be represented by matrices,
 which form various "representations" of the group. These
 representations may be used to determine how a physical system changes
 under the action of symmetry transformations. Moreover, when a system
 possesses a symmetry which is described by a group <b>G</b> (i.e. when its
 equations of motion are left invariant under group transformations),
 then the various representations specify the symmetry properties of
 the relevant degrees of freedom.
 </p><p align="justify">
 For example, hadrons appear to possess an <i>SU</i>(3) "flavor"
 symmetry. The fundamental 3-dimensional representation of <i>SU</i>(3)
 contains the three flavor degrees of freedom associated with the up,
 down and strange quarks: <b>3</b> = (u, d, s). The eight-dimensional
 representation <b>8</b> of <i>SU</i>(3) contains the eight flavor
 degrees of freedom 
 associated with the meson and baryon octets.
 Furthermore, a given representation completely specifies the flavor
 quantum numbers of associated particles.
 </p><p align="justify">
 The same is true for local gauge (i.e. dynamical) symmetries. For
 example, the theory of QCD possesses a local <i>SU</i>(3)<sub>C</sub> color
 symmetry. The three-dimensional representation of SU(3)c contains the
 three color degrees of freedom associated with the color charges red,
 green and blue: <b>3</b> = (r, g, b). The eight-dimensional representation
 contains the eight color degrees of freedom associated with the eight
 gluons the gauge bosons of QCD.
 </p><p align="justify">
 Discrete groups having a finite number of elements are associated
 with discrete symmetry transformations, such as parity. For example,
 the discrete group corresponding to parity has only two elements: <b>P</b>
 and <b>P</b><sup>2</sup> = <i>e</i>.
