 another neutron is captured (cf. <i>r</i>-process). This a slow but

 <td valign="top"><b>Scattering</b>
 </td><td><p align="justify">(a) The `spreading out' of a beam of radiation as it
 passes through matter, reducing the energy moving in the original
 direction. Depending on the circumstances, scattering can follow any
 combination of three processes as the radiation interacts with matter
 particles - reflection (elastic scattering), absorption followed by
 re-radiation (inelastic or Compton scattering), and diffraction. Thus
 sunlight is scattered (or diffused) as it passes through cloud and
 dust in the atmosphere. However, even perfectly clear air scatters
 sunlight, making the sky color blue - high frequencies are scattered
 more than low frequencies. <a href="../glossary.html#DC99" target="ads_dw">[DC99]</a>
 <br> (b) The process whereby light is absorbed and
 reemitted in all

 knowledge about the
 natural universe, plus the body of knowledge obtained that way. It is both
 a method and the resulting understanding and knowledge. The method
 requires making models to explain phenomena, testing them experimentally, 
 and revising them until they work. The goal of science is understanding. 
 Once part of the natural world is understood, it may be possible
 to develop applications of the new knowledge. The process of developing
 such applications is properly called technology, not science. Although 
 scientific knowledge may, and usually does, lead to technology, science is 
 not necessary for technology, and technological developments have led to
 new science as much as the opposite. Before the time of Galileo, many
 technological developments occurred that had no scientific connection.
 Since the time of Maxwell and his formulation of the electromagnetic
 theory, nearly all technological developments have depended on earlier
 science. In recent years the words science and technology have been 
 frequently misused, as though they were interchangeable. Because science
 and technology are really different, it is better to distinguish carefully 
 between them.

 that infinities do not exist in nature. All singularities, such as
 the Schwarzschild singularity, are therefore probably the artifacts of
 inadequate theories rather than real properties of nature. According
 to Einstein's theory of general relativity, the Universe began in a
 singularity of infinite density, the big bang. Physicists believe that
 an improved and yet-to-be discovered modification of general
 relativity, incorporating quantum mechanics, will show that the
 Universe did not begin as a singularity. (see Schwarzschild
 Singularity.) <a href="../glossary.html#LB90" target="ads_dw">[LB90]</a>

  <br>(b) Theory formulated by Albert Einstein
 comprising two basic yet very original propositions: that a spaceship
 (or other enclosed vessel) traveling at uniform speed through space
 contains its own space-time continuum, and that a ray of light passes
 an observer at the speed of light no matter how (uniformly) fast nor
 in what direction the observer is travelling. One consequence of this
 theory was the equation of mass (<i>m</i>) with energy (<i>E</i>),
 formulated as <i>E</i> = <i>mc</i><sup>2</sup> (where <i>c</i> is the
 speed of light). Ten years later, Einstein 
 produced his General Theory of Relativity. <a href="../glossary.html#A84" target="ads_dw">[A84]</a>
 <br> (c) A theory of space, time and motion formulated by
 Einstein in 1905. The theory was generalized in 1915 to include
 gravity (see General Theory of Relativity). <a href="../glossary.html#D89" target="ads_dw">[D89]</a>
 <br>
 (d) The constraints of special relativity are two conditions that Einstein
 pointed out should be satisfied by any acceptable physical theory. Somewhat 
 oversimplified, these conditions are, first, that light moves at the
 same speed in vacuum regardless of how it is emitted and, second, that
 scientists working in different labs moving with different relative speeds
 should formulate the same natural laws. The constraints imposed by
 these conditions have surprising implications for the structure of 
 acceptable theories. For example, the Schrodinger equation of quantum
 theory does not satisfy these conditions. But when it was generalized by
 Dirac to do so, the resulting equation led to the prediction of
 antiparticles, which need not have existed from the point of view of
 quantum theory alone. <a href="../glossary.html#K2000" target="ads_dw">[K2000]</a>

 </td><td><p align="justify">(a) A quantum property of all particles which denotes
 the intrinsic angular momentum of the particle. <a href="../glossary.html#C97" target="ads_dw">[C97]</a>
 <br>
 (b) The intrinsic angular momentum possessed by many
 particles. It can be 
 thought of as resulting from the particles spinning about an axis
 through their centers. In contrast to orbital angular momentum, spin
 is quantized in integer and half-integer units of <img src="../GIFS/hbar.gif" alt="hbar">. Fundamentally,
 spin describes how quantum fields transform under the transformations
 of special relativity. <a href="../glossary.html#CD99" target="ads_dw">[CD99]</a>
 <br>
 (c) A quantum-mechanical version of the familiar
 notion of the same 
 name; particles have an intrinsic amount of spin that is either a whole
 number or half a whole number (in multiples of Plancks constant), and
 which never changes. <a href="../glossary.html#G99" target="ads_dw">[G99]</a>
 <br> (d) The intrinsic angular momentum of an elementary
 particle, as by 
 the particle's spinning on its axis. Spin is quantized in units of
 Planck's constant of action, <i>h</i>, so that, e.g., "spin 1,"
 means spin = 1<i>h</i>. Particles with integral spin (0, 1) are called
 bosons; those with half spin are fermions. <a href="../glossary.html#F88" target="ads_dw">[F88]</a>
 <br> (e) Electrons, protons and neutrons have an intrinsic
 angular momentum, known as spin, of
 1/2 <img src="../New_Gifs/hbar.gif" alt="hbar"> and a magnetic moment
 parallel (or 
 antiparallel) to that angular momentum. When electrons are combined
 together to form an atom or ion there is a resultant angular momentum
 which is a combination of the intrinsic spin of the electrons and the
 angular momentum due to their motion about the nucleus, which is
 called the spin of the atom or ion; there is also a magnetic moment
 associated with this angular momentum (unless it is zero). Such atoms
 or ions with nonzero spin are therefore magnetic atoms or ions. The
 protons and neutrons in a nucleus also combine together in the same
 way to give a nuclear spin, but the magnetic moments associated with
 the nuclei are much smaller, and are only important for magnetic
 materials at exceedingly low temperatures. <a href="../glossary.html#D89" target="ads_dw">[D89]</a>
 <br>
 (f) Spin  is  a property  that  all particles  have.  It  is as  though
 particles were always spinning at  a fixed rate (which could be zero),
 which can  be different according to  the type of particle.  It is not
 quite right to think of  them actually spinning, because the particles
 do  not have  to have  spatial extension  to have  spin;  calling this
 property spin  is an analogy.  The amount of  spin is required  by the
 quantum theory to  come in definite amounts; if the  unit is chosen to
 be Planck's constant, <i>h</i>, divided  by 2, then particles can have
 zero spin, half a unit of spin, one unit of spin, etc.  <a href="../glossary.html#K2000" target="ads_dw">[K2000]</a>

 <br><a href="Essay_ssb.html"><img src="essay1.gif" alt="Essay" border="0"></a>
 </td><td><p align="justify">(a) The breaking of an exact symmetry of
 the underlying laws of physics by the random formation of some
 object. For example, the rotational in variance of the laws of physics
 can be broken by the randomly chosen orientation of an orthorhombic
 crystal that condenses as the material is cooled. In the standard
 model of particle physics, the symmetry between electrons and
 neutrinos is spontaneously broken by the values that are randomly
 chosen by the Higgs fields. In grand unified theories, the symmetry
 between electrons, neutrinos, and quarks is spontaneously broken by
 the values chosen randomly by the Higgs fields. <a href="../glossary.html#G97" target="ads_dw">[G97]</a>
 <br> (b) Any situation in physics in which the ground
 state (i.e. the state of 
 minimum energy) of a system has less symmetry than the system
 itself. For example, the state of minimum energy for an iron magnet is
 that in which the atomic spins are all aligned in the same direction,
 giving rise to a net macroscopic magnetic field. By selecting a
 particular direction in space. the magnetic field has broken the
 rotational symmetry of the system. However, if the energy of the
 system is raised, the symmetry may be restored (e.g. the application
 of heat to an iron magnet destroys the magnetic field and restores
 rotational symmetry). <a href="../glossary.html#CD99" target="ads_dw">[CD99]</a>
 <br> (c) In many physical systems the actual
 state of the system does not reflect the underlying symmetries of the
 dynamics because the manifestly symmetric state is unstable. The
 system then trades stability for asymmetry. The symmetry breaking in
 this case is said to be spontaneous. <a href="../glossary.html#D89" target="ads_dw">[D89]</a>
 <br>
 (d) Often the equations of a theory may have certain symmetries, though
 their solutions may not; the symmetries are hidden, or broken. For
 example, the equations may describe several particles in identical
 ways, so the equations are unchanged if the particles are interchanged,
 but the solutions may give the particles different properties. This
 phenomenon is called spontaneous symmetry  breaking. <a href="../glossary.html#K2000" target="ads_dw">[K2000]</a>

 signify a peculiar group of objects (usually spectral type Me)
 that display a combination of low-temperature absorption spectra and
 high-temperature emission lines. These objects undergo 
 semiperiodic nova-like outbursts and display the spectral
 changes of a slow nova superposed on the features of a late-type
 star. Their spectra are midway between those of planetary nebulae and
 true stellar objects. A symbiotic star is now usually taken

 rotated. <a href="../glossary.html#G99" target="ads_dw">[G99]</a>
 <br> (b) State of a system such that it has a significant
 quantity that remains invariant after a transformation. More
 generally, an apt or pleasing proportion based upon such a
 state. <a href="../glossary.html#F88" target="ads_dw">[F88]</a>
 <br>(c) The property of being unchanged after some
 transformation. A 
 square, for example, has a 4-sided rotational symmetry. It appears the
 same after it is rotated by 90 degrees. <a href="../glossary.html#LB90" target="ads_dw">[LB90]</a>
 <br>
 (d) If a theory or process does not change when certain
 operations are performed on it, then we say that it possesses a
 symmetry with respect to those operations. For example a circle
 remains unchanged under rotation or reflection. It therefore has
 rotational and reflection symmetry. <a href="../glossary.html#D89" target="ads_dw">[D89]</a>
 <br> (e) Abstract mathematical relationships
 that relate elementary particles together and allow them to be grouped
 into families. A particular symmetry transformation has the effect of,
 in a theoretical way, transforming one elementary particle into
 another. Important symmetries include:

 <br> (c) The process by which an intrinsic symmetry of a
 system is disrupted. For example, a compass, in the absence of any
 outside magnetic field, has rotational symmetry and is equally likely
 to point in any direction. The magnetic field of the earth breaks the
 symmetry and causes the compass to point in a particular direction,
 toward the earth's north magnetic pole. In some cosmological models,
 the infant Universe was much more symmetric than it is today. As the
 Universe aged and cooled, some of these symmetries were permanently
 broken. <a href="../glossary.html#LB90" target="ads_dw">[LB90]</a>

 <br>(b) The radiation emitted by ultrarelativistic charged particles that
 are circulating in strong magnetic fields. The acceleration of the
 particles causes them to emit radiation. A characteristic of such
 radiation is that it is polarized, and the wavelength region in which
 the emission occurs depends on the energy of the electron - e.g., 1
