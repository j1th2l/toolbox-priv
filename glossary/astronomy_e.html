 formation. "E+A" galaxies show strong Balmer absorption lines
 (EW<hbeta, gamma,="" delta=""> &gt; 5.5 Angstroms) and weak [OII] emission
 (EW[OII] &lt; 2.5 Angstroms). The standard interpretation is that these
 are post-starburst galaxies in which star formation ceased within the
 last gigayear. The mechanisms responsible for the formation of "E+A"
 galaxies are not fully understood, neither has the environment in
 which these galaxies have been found been fully defined.
 These objects are also sometimes referred to as "K+A" galaxies.

 binary stars also accord with this pattern. Alternatively - and

 <td valign="top"><b>Eddy Currents</b>
 </td><td><p align="justify">Induced currents set up in a conductor by a

 electrical devices. The currents produce a heating effect
 corresponding to a loss of useful energy (<i>eddy-current
 loss</i>). Metal cores in electrical machines are usually laminated
 (built of thin sheets) to reduce such losses; the surface layers
 between the laminations have high electrical resistance.
 <br>
 One useful application of eddy currents is in damping moving-coil
 instruments - the coil is wound on a piece of soft iron. When the coil
 moves in the instrument's magnetic field, eddy currents are induced in
 the iron so as to oppose the motion, causing the coil to settle
 quickly. As Lenz's law would predict, eddy currents always flow so as
 to oppose the effect producing them. <a href="../glossary.html#DC99" target="ads_dw">[DC99]</a>

 <br> (b) Tested by Galileo in the famous experiments at
 Pisa, this principle asserts the identity of the inertial mass of an

 field. In Newtonian physics this has to be inserted `by hand' whereas
 in general relativity it emerges from the formalism automatically. <a href="../glossary.html#D89" target="ads_dw">[D89]</a>
 <br> (c) The statement that a gravitational force is
 completely equivalent in all of its physical effects to an overall
 acceleration in the opposite direction. For example, a person in an
 elevator in space accelerating upward at 32 feet per second per second
 would feel the floor pushing upward against her feet in exactly the
 same way as if the elevator were at rest on earth, where gravity pulls
 downward with an acceleration of 32 feet per second per second. The
 "weak equivalence principle," which is not as strong as the
 equivalence principle, states that all objects, independent of their
 mass or composition, fall with the same acceleration in the presence
 of gravity. The Eötvös experiment, and later refinements of this
